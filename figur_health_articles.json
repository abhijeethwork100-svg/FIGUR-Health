      "Since existence, humans have walked to gather food, protect themselves, and move around to survive in different climates. Walking has always been more than just moving around. Now that we have settled into a much more sedentary lifestyle, walking has also become our means to achieve and maintain fitness.",
      "For fitness lovers, walking has become a form of exercise with significant health benefits. In India diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart issues are common. As such, walking can become a game-changing activity.",
      "But how much walking is enough to guarantee weight loss? Some experts suggest 10,000 steps a day can really make a difference to your health.",
      "But, do you really need to walk 10,000 steps every day?",
      "This article is your answer. Read on to know if 10,000 steps a day can result in weight loss. Moreover, understand how to start an unbeatable walking routine. Get some practical tips for optimising your walk.",
      "Dr. Yoshiro Hatano's work[1] inspired a company to develop an early form of a pedometer in the 1960s. Concerned with the way the Japanese were adopting a sedentary lifestyle, Dr Hatano devised an interesting strategy. If only he could convince fellow Japanese citizens to walk 10,000 steps daily. His countrymen would burn a staggering 500 calories in a single day.",
      "The result? They would get slim and stay slim. This idea sparked the '10,000 steps a day' program, which turned out to be a marketing hit.",
      "The company named the step-tracking device 'manpo-kei,' which means '10,000 steps measure'. Over time, this target gained global popularity as a benchmark for physical activity. Many health organisations and fitness enthusiasts endorsed it.",
      "10,000 steps also equal to:",
      "This equals burning almost 2,100 to 3,100 calories per week through walking alone.",
      "In 2004, researchers Catrine Tudor-Locke and David R. Bassett Jr introduced graduated step index for healthy adults.[2]",
      "According to their research, they developed an index of physical activity levels according to daily steps. They categorised individuals into sedentary, low activity, somewhat active, active, and highly active groups.",
      "However, preliminary evidence[2] suggests that a goal of 10,000 steps a day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases (more on this in a minute).",
      "Another concern about using 10,000 steps/day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population who struggle with obesity.",
      "So, the researchers came up with revised step targets for different individuals, which came to this:",
      "Walking 10,000 steps a day isn't just a marketing strategy. Several studies support that people who walked 10,000 steps a day at medium to fast pace and ate a healthy diet saw great results. They lost weight, felt better overall, reduced their waist size, and experienced improvements in physical fitness and mental health.",
      "The 10,000 steps per day are an ideal target. However, studies show that even 7,500 steps a day can reduce the risk of chronic diseases to a great extent. The key is to stay consistently active.",
      "For example, a study[3] by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reported a breakthrough finding. Women taking at least 4,400 steps daily had a significantly lower mortality rate over a four-year period compared to those taking fewer steps.",
      "However, aiming higher is even better. So, 10,000 steps a day can make you feel more positive about your body and motivate you to perform more physical activity.",
      "But it doesn't end there. Walking offers a wide range of benefits apart from motivation. Below a non-exhaustive list:",
      "A team of scientists at Edinburgh University conducted a study to understand how walking impacts the human body. Here’s what they found:",
      "While walking benefits most people, it’s best to proceed with caution in some instances:",
      "While walking is a low-impact exercise, and taking small, slow steps is beneficial for arthritis pain management, excessive walking might worsen joint pain if you have severe arthritis. High impact on joints can lead to further damage and discomfort. Consult your doctor before deciding to walk 10,000 steps every day.",
      "Surgeries can tire the body. Recovering from a recent surgery? Avoid strenuous activities until you heal completely. This helps ensure a smooth recovery.",
      "Walking long distances can strain the heart and muscles. If you have chronic health and heart conditions, start slowly. You can gradually increase the steps as and when your doctor advises.",
      "Even when doing something as simple as walking, always listen to your body. Understand your body's tolerance levels. Seek medical advice if you have underlying health issues. A healthcare professional can help you start safely.",
      "Is walking something you cannot do right now? Why not try alternate options like swimming or cycling? These activities will help you stay fit without complicating your health. It is like having your cake and eating it too!",
      "We know, walking 10,000 steps a day might feel like such a task. But, when you do it the right way, you are sure to enjoy every bit.",
      "Yes, the 10,000-step a day goal is a popular benchmark. But it is important to consider individual starting points. Many office workers average 3,000 to 5,000 steps daily, while sedentary individuals may only manage 1,000.",
      "Remember, this isn't a one-size-fits-all approach.",
      "Begin with achievable goals and gradually increase your step count. Starting small will save you from burnout and reduce the risk of injury.",
      "Your walking shoes can make or break your fitness regimen. Ideally, these shoes should be comfortable, with enough space for your toes to move freely. They should provide the right level of arch support and good cushioning to absorb shock. Shoes with a firm midsole, a supportive heel counter, and a durable rubber outsole can offer adequate stability and traction.",
      "Mesh uppers or perforated panels will keep your feet comfortable and dry by allowing airflow. Additionally, they should offer good motion and flexibility to support natural foot movement.",

      "While focusing on specific targets like walking 10,000 steps is natural, goals can change or shift over time. On the other hand, systems help you continue your progress instead of simply achieving it. Basically, this means that the journey is more important than the destination itself.",
      "Here are some quick tips you can try to set up a walking routine for yourself:",
      "Get a Pedometer: Invest in an accurate pedometer or fitness tracker. Apps like Google Fit and Apple Health can help you monitor your activity levels and provide motivation. Try walking for at least 30 minutes every day or squeeze in short, frequent walks if you don’t have a pedometer.",
      "Track Your Baseline: For the first week, track your normal daily steps without changing your routine. Calculate your average daily steps by adding the total steps for the week and dividing by seven.",
      "Set Gradual Goals: Gradually increase your daily steps by 10-20% each week. For example, if your baseline is 5,000 steps, aim for 5,500 to 6,000 steps the next week.",
      "Speed: For weight loss, experts recommend a quicker pace of 5.6 to 7.2 kilometres per hour for at least 30 minutes. Serious enthusiasts can aim for speeds of 6.4 to 8 kilometres per hour or faster.",
      "Add Steps Throughout Your Day: Opt for the stairs over elevators. Get off the bus or train one stop early. Walk to the nearby market instead of driving.",
      "Add Formal Exercise: To reach your goal, add a 20-30-minute walk in the morning or evening. This can be outdoors or on a treadmill.",
      "Monitor and Adjust: Continue to track your steps and adjust your goals. You may reach 10,000 steps in three weeks. Or maybe, you need to continue increasing your steps by 10-20% each week until you build the habit. No matter what, keep going.",
      "Stay Consistent: Track your steps daily and make small, manageable changes to your routine to increase your activity level.",
      "Here are some things you can do to maximise the benefits of walking 10,000 steps every day.",

      "When done right, curdling ensures the resulting cheese is soft and has a non-bitter taste.",

      "If we compare homemade paneer with store-bought version, homemade paneer is fresher, softer, and certainly free from preservatives and additives. You can also make low-fat paneer at home from skimmed milk. This reduces your intake of saturated fat.",
      "However, its high moisture content makes it more likely to be spoiled by microorganisms. When stored at 4°C or below, paneer can retain its freshness for about three days. Refrigerating it at around -18°C can extend its shelf life for upto four months!",

      "Can we do surya namaskar in the evening?",
      "Practising surya namaskar in the morning (at sunrise) is a great way to relieve your body of stiffness and refresh the mind.",
      "However, it doesn't mean you cannot do it at evening. Doing it at evening[2] or at night will help you destress better. The important thing is that there must be a gap of 2-3 hours between your last meal and exercise.",
      "I am a beginner. Can I do surya namaskar?",
      "Yes, why not? At the beginner stage, it is recommended that you start slow, focus on keeping your postures correct and aligning the breathing patterns accordingly.",
      "What should I do if I feel dizzy while practising?",
      "If at any point you feel dizzy while performing the surya namaskar, the first thing to do is STOP. Then, rest in a seated position and seek medical care immediately if the symptoms persist.",
      "How many rounds of surya namaskar should I perform daily for weight loss?",
      "You can start with a few warm-up exercises followed by 5-6 rounds of surya namaskar in the beginning. As you build stamina, strength, and flexibility, gradually increase the count to 12 rounds.",
      "This will give the best results if you maintain a healthy diet and a calorie deficit as well.",
      "Is it necessary to chant mantras during surya namaskar?",
      "Although reciting them isn’t mandatory, chanting the beej mantras associated with the individual poses can enhance the practice by deepening the spiritual connection and creating a more meditative experience.",
      "Here are the beej mantras that are associated with the different poses of surya namaskar:",
      "Can children practice surya namaskar?",
      "Yes. Children can practice surya namaskar under adult supervision to ensure they do so with the right technique and posture.",
      "In fact, children are gifted with more flexibility than adults, which is why practising surya namaskars from early childhood can enhance their physical strength and improve their mental focus.",
      "Is it necessary to warm up before doing surya namaskar?",
      "Doing a light walk, jog, or some stretches before surya namaskar (or any other exercise) will ensure that your muscles receive adequate blood flow and your joints are ready for extra physical load.",
      "Can surya namaskar reduce belly fat?",
      "When combined with a healthy diet, positive lifestyle changes, and adequate calorie deficit, surya namaskar can be an effective way to lose belly fat. It is a full-body workout.",
      "However, only doing surya namaskar cannot help with spot reduction. This exercise does engage the abdominal muscles but actual fat loss is only possible through consistent physical activity, strength training, and a balanced diet.",
      "Can I practice surya namaskar indoors?",
      "Definitely. You only need a nice, clean space where you can move around freely.",
      "Can surya namaskar help in weight loss?",
      "As discussed above, doing surya namaskar regularly is a great way of losing body fat and maintaining a healthy BMI.",
      "You can burn almost 14 calories with every round of surya namaskar. With time, your body becomes more efficient in utilising energy, which is essential for losing weight.",
      "Can I do surya namaskar during periods?",
      "Doing surya namaskar during periods is a personal choice and depends on how you feel. If you regularly experience severe cramps, fatigue, or heavy flow during your period, it's best to rest or do very gentle movements.",
      "In such instances, avoid deep forward bends or high-intensity rounds so that you do not experience pressure on the abdomen.",
      "If you have PCOS, endometriosis, or fibroids, it's best to consult your doctor before you practise surya namaskar.",
      "Can I take a bath immediately after doing surya namaskar?",
      "It is best to wait a while before you take a bath after your surya namaskar routine. This will allow your warmed-up body to cool down gently and prevent it from being exposed to sudden shifts in temperature. Wait for 20-30 minutes post-exercise before you head to the showers.",

      "Are there any specific types of coffee beans that are better for weight loss?",
      "Any coffee, green or black, can help with weight loss. Green coffee beans, rich in chlorogenic acids, may reduce fat absorption and increase metabolism.",
      "Black coffee's higher caffeine content can increase fat burning and suppress appetite. But they're most effective when combined with a healthy diet and exercise.",
      "Also, freshly roasted, properly brewed beans will taste better, meaning you're less likely to want to add calorie-laden creamers or sweeteners.",
      "Does black coffee have any impact on mood?",
      "Yes. Because of its caffeine content, drinking black coffee often has favourable effects on mood. If taken in moderate amounts, black coffee makes one more alert and increases problem-solving skills. It also lowers the severity of the symptoms associated with depression.",
      "But, drinking caffeine in excess can manifest as increased anxiety or jitteriness.",
      "Can we drink black coffee on an empty stomach for weight loss?",
      "Yes, some people may see weight loss by drinking black coffee on an empty stomach. Black coffee (especially without sugar or cream) is low in calories and contains caffeine. Caffeine can increase metabolism and enhance fat burning temporarily. It may also suppress your appetite for a while, which again reduces the calories you consume.",
      "However, some people may experience stomach irritation or increased hunger after drinking black coffee this way. If you have acid reflux or other digestive issues, consult your doctor before you add this to your weight loss plan.",

      "Let’s answer this right away—a medium-sized roti contains up to 106 calories, 22.32g of carbohydrates, 3.84g to 5.28g of protein, 2.84g of fibre, and 0.52g of fats.",
      "It’s a delight to eat piping hot rotis with some delicious homemade sabzi (vegetables) and dals (lentils).",
      "Roti, also known as chapati, phulka, or poli in different regions of India, is an unleavened flatbread usually made with whole wheat flour, water, salt, and a little fat (oil/ghee).",
      "It is a staple meal in most Indian households and a primary source of energy. Remember how it was the go-to lunch box meal?",
      "However, is it all still the same?",
      "Today, you are probably looking at the hot roti, topped with ghee, and wondering if even one roti will add some grams to your weight.",
      "Maybe, you are struggling to count the calories in one roti - and that is stopping you from enjoying a satisfying, nostalgia-filled meal.",
      "The ingredients in the roti—wheat flour, water, salt, and oil/ghee are usually healthy when we eat them in moderate amounts.",
      "However, in excessive amounts or under certain conditions, these ingredients can have undesirable effects on our health.",
      "But, several factors influence the calorie content of rotis—the type of flour used, size, thickness, and even cooking methods.",
      "But does this mean that roti isn’t good for you? This is far from the truth.",
      "If you are an avid weight watcher, read on to find out how roti benefits your health, how you can lose weight by eating it, and how you can make it healthier.",
      "Rotis are not only filling, but are equally nutritious.",
      "With 106 calories in one roti, 22.32g carbs, 3.84g to 5.28g protein, 2.84g dietary fibre, and just 0.52g fat, roti is surely nutritious, provided you eat it in moderate amounts.",
      "Let’s see the nutrients in one roti*:",
      "*The values discussed here are for one medium-sized, whole wheat roti.",
      "Did you know?",
      "Multigrain rotis are more nutritious[1] compared to regular wheat rotis. They are a blend of whole grains like wheat, jowar, bajra, and more. With a moderate glycemic index (55-69) and 70-85 calories in one multigrain roti, they prevent huge spikes in blood sugar.",
      "Rotis are largely made of wheat flour, but wheat isn’t the only kind of flour out there. You can experiment with rotis made from different flours.",
      "So before you decide how many chapatis/rotis to eat, it is important to know how many calories you would be consuming if you usually have more than one roti.",
      "These are approximate values for a medium-sized (18 cm diameter or 40g) chapatis/roti:",
      "The calorie count for a roti/chapati will change if it differs in size or is topped with add-on calories.",
      "For instance, calories in roti without ghee will be less than calories in roti with ghee.",
      "Or, 3 small chapati calories may be equal to 1 big chapati calories.",
      "All of it boils down to how you prefer to eat your rotis.",
      "Understanding this will either take a masterclass in roti nutrition or you may just have to step into the kitchen with a weighing scale and count the calories in chapatis/roti the right way.",
      "The short, and perhaps the only answer you need to hear - No, it doesn’t!",
      "The answer is also the same for mangoes, ghee, avocados, parathas, or basically anything you eat.",
      "The real culprit here is not following healthy practices like portion control, balanced workout, sleeping well, and maintaining a calorie deficit.",
      "So, is roti healthy?",
      "Fitness and lifestyle coach Arjhan Rai says, “Roti is just a food. It's not going to make you fat or thin. You need to understand your calorie intake and then you can eat whatever you want and still lose weight.”",
      "He also explains this with an interesting logic in his Instagram post.",
      "TL;DR? Roti comes with some heavy calories. If you want to switch to healthier alternatives, check out our web story below.",
      "Looks interesting, right? Check out more web stories as well!",
      "While most people enjoy eating wheat rotis, there are certain instances where it is helpful to seek alternatives:",
      "Whether roti is healthy or not has been a very controversial topic in health circles. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make it any healthier.",
      "Curious how to do so? Check out these super useful tips to explore healthy alternatives to roti:",
      "If you need more healthy alternatives to roti or explore healthy ways to reduce the amount of calories in chapatis, check out this interesting and ‘nutrient-packed’ thread on Reddit:",
      "When eaten right, a roti nourishes you with essential nutrients and keeps you energised throughout the day.",
      "But like any food that is mostly carbs, pair it with sufficient protein, fibre, and fats so you can balance your meals and avoid excess snacking.",
      "While making your rotis, prefer whole grain varieties over refined atta whenever possible, and you are good to go!",
      "Finding the perfect balance in your diet is just one part of your weight loss plans. If weight management is on your to-do list, Aktive is here for you.",
      "Our experts understand that every person is unique, and we're here to guide you with hassle-free, evidence-based weight loss plans that do not ask you to starve yourself and yet, help you reach your desired weight.",
      "Can multigrain rotis help with weight loss?",
      "Yes. Multigrain rotis are a healthy way to lose weight, as they are rich in dietary fibre, which reduces hunger levels.",
      "Multigrain rotis are usually made from a mix of wheat, chickpea flour, millets, bajra, barley, oats, ragi, maize, and jowar (sorghum) flour.",
      "They also have a lower glycemic index compared to refined wheat atta rotis, which means your blood sugar levels wouldn't spike as much. Both these mechanisms are important for helping you lose weight.",
      "Are multigrain rotis gluten-free?",
      "This depends on the type of grain that has been used to make the flour. If they contain a significant portion of wheat flour, they wouldn't be gluten-free.",
      "On the other hand, using only gluten-free flour like bajra, ragi, jowar, millet flour, etc., are more suitable for people with gluten sensitivity.",
      "How does the size of a roti affect its calorie count?",
      "The bigger the roti, the more calories are in it. For example, a medium-sized roti (approximately 40 grams) contains around 112 calories.",
      "As the size increases, so will the amount of flour and other ingredients used. Also, a smaller roti might be just as unhealthy as a bigger one if one applies too much ghee/oil to it.",
      "What you put inside or outside the roti also affects the calorie count.",
      "This is why we need to be mindful of our portions to manage the overall calorie intake.",
      "What’s healthier: Roti or rice?",
      "In this case, 'healthy' can mean different things to people with different dietary needs. Roti (especially wheat or multigrain) is usually healthier due to its high fibre and protein content, but someone with gluten sensitivity can't eat the same roti.",
      "In such cases, rice can be a better alternative as it is a complex carbohydrate, gluten-free, and has some protein. In this case, you can combine it with adequate amounts of vegetables, dals, salad, and buttermilk, which increases its nutrient value.",
      "Is it okay to eat roti every day?",
      "Yes, you can surely eat roti every day, but eat it in limited amounts and pair it with sabzi, dal, salad, curd, or buttermilk. Eating roti daily takes care of our energy needs and provides fibre, nutrients, and healthy fats to the body.",
      "Is ghee roti bad for you?",
      "When taken in moderation, ghee is certainly a healthy addition to your meals. In fact, doctors recommend eating upto a teaspoonful of ghee every day for good health.",
      "Applying ghee to roti adds flavour and essential fatty acids to it. But yes, its high-fat content can add to your daily calorie intake (1 ghee roti carries approximately 126-165 calories), ultimately leading to weight gain. This can be avoided by eating ghee roti in moderation.",
      "How many calories are in a plain roti with sabzi (vegetable curry)?",
      "A plain roti paired with sabzi will increase the total roti calories to 170-300. This depends on the ingredients of the sabzi and how it's made. Eating sabzi made with less oil will add some good calories to your diet.",
      "How many rotis should I eat for weight loss?",
      "The number of rotis one needs to eat for weight loss may vary according to one's present health condition, dietary needs, and activity levels. As a rule, you can have 1-2 rotis or phulkas with every meal to lose weight.",
      "You can also eat rotis made of jowar, bajra, or ragi flour or mix them with some parts of wheat flour to add more fibre and nutrients to your meal.",
      "What are some low-calorie side dishes to pair with roti?",
      "Some low-calorie dishes you can enjoy with roti include:",
      "Can you freeze rotis to save cooking time during the week?",
      "Yes, you can prepare rotis in advance and freeze them. Roll the roti dough as usual, but only half-cook them on both sides. Once done, store the rotis together in a zip-lock bag or an airtight container.",
      "Place parchment paper or cling film between every roti so that they don't stick. You can reheat them on a non-stick tawa or microwave them for 15-20 seconds and enjoy.",
      "How much protein does a roti have?",
      "1 medium-sized whole wheat roti (approx. 40g in weight) contains around 3.84g to 5.28g of protein. This is dependent on the flour used and the preparation method. For example, a roti made with besan (chickpea flour) or multigrain atta can have slightly higher amounts of protein.",
      "If you are wondering how to balance out your overall protein intake throughout the day, you can use these pointers as a general guideline:",

      "Yes, mangoes can be enjoyed during your eating window, but they must be avoided during fasting.",
      "They’re rich in natural sugars and calories, so if you’re doing something like a 16:8 fast, eat ½ to 1 cup of mango between 12 and 8 pm, and pair it with protein or fat to avoid sudden sugar spikes. Don’t go overboard; too much fruit sugar may interfere with fat burning or ketosis.",
      "Is it safe to eat mango peel?",
      "Mango peels are rich in antioxidants, fibre, and compounds like mangiferin that support immunity and inflammation control. That said, they’re not commonly eaten, and for good reason. The peel may taste different, be hard to digest, and contain pesticide residues.",
      "Some people may also react to a compound in the peel called urushiol (also found in poison ivy and cashews), which can trigger rashes or allergies.",
      "Unless you're using organic mangoes, washing them thoroughly, and have no sensitivity, it’s better to peel them, especially when serving children, pregnant women, or those with gut issues.",
      "Can I eat mangoes if I have PCOS?",
      "Mangoes are safe for people with PCOS if eaten in moderation. They offer antioxidants like quercetin, vitamin C, and a decent dose of fibre, all of which help manage inflammation and insulin resistance.",

      "I have thyroid. Can I eat mangoes?",
      "Yes, mangoes are generally safe for people with thyroid disorders. They’re a good source of antioxidants, vitamin A, and even trace amounts of iodine, all of which support thyroid function.",
      "They also don’t contain strong goitrogens, so there’s little risk of interference. Just be careful with timing. You can have a mango at least one hour after taking your thyroid medication, like levothyroxine, to avoid absorption issues.",
      "Which is better, raw or ripe mango?",
      "Raw mango has fewer sugars, a lower glycaemic index (GI), and fewer calories, making it better for weight loss, PCOS, or sugar control. It also works beautifully in pickles, salads, and chutneys.",
      "Conversely, ripe mango is sweeter and richer in antioxidants like mangiferin and vitamin C. It’s excellent for general nutrition but needs portion control, especially for those managing weight or diabetes.",
      "I have irritable bowel syndrome. Can I eat mangoes?",
      "Mangoes can be eaten by people with IBS or FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) sensitivities, but it's best to have them in tiny portions. While the fibre in mangoes might be helpful for some digestion concerns, their FODMAP content could cause some digestive discomfort.",
      "You can limit your intake to ¼ cup (about 30–50g) of mangoes, particularly during the initial phases of a low-FODMAP diet.",
      "Working with a dietitian can be helpful in identifying your specific triggers. It's also a good idea to gradually introduce mangoes and perhaps avoid them if experiencing an IBS flare-up.",
      "Can children eat mangoes?",
      "Mangoes are great for kids as they are sweet and nutrient-rich. Just watch out for the sugar (it can affect teeth) and allergies (like to cashews).",
      "Cut them into small bits to avoid choking, stick to a small amount (like ¼ cups for little ones, ½ cups for bigger kids), maybe once or twice a day, and rinse their mouths afterwards.",
      "Is it safe to eat mangoes during pregnancy?",
      "Yes, a pregnant woman can eat mangoes during her pregnancy in moderation. Mangoes are a good source of iron, folic acid, fibre, and vitamins (A, B6, & C). These nutrients are essential for neural tube development, immunity, and digestive health.",
      "However, they are also high in natural sugars, which may increase the chances of getting gestational diabetes. Always consult your doctor or nutritionist before making mangoes a part of your diet.",
      "Does eating mango have any side effects?",
      "Eating something as healthy as a mango has a bright side and a downside. Let’s take a quick look at the latter:",
      "What factors affect the calorie content of mangoes?",
      "Some factors have a significant effect on the calorie content of mangoes:",
      "Do different mango varieties have different calorie counts?",
      "Yes, the calorie content can vary among mango varieties due to differences in sugar, water, and other nutrients.",
      "For example,",
      "Which fruit is better for workout fuel, a mango or a banana?",
      "Both mangoes and bananas can be good workout fuel! Mangoes might give you a quicker energy boost because of their sugar, which is excellent if you need something fast before a shorter workout.",
      "On the other hand, bananas have more carbs and potassium, which can help you sustain through longer workouts and help your muscles recover better.",
      "How not to eat mangoes?",
      "Ayurvedic and Unani medicine expert Dr. Saleem Zaidi suggests that combining mango with certain foods is not so beneficial for the body. This food incompatibility (viruddha aahar) can affect digestion. He recommends the following:",
      "If you're into Ayurveda, these suggestions might help keep you comfortable. Otherwise, listen to your body and determine what works best for you.",
      "Is aamras healthy?",
      "Aamras can be a healthy treat in moderation. It gives you fibre, good vitamins, and antioxidants. However, if you add sugar or ghee, it can become high in calories. So, if you're watching your weight or blood sugar, it's something to be mindful of.",
      "To make aamras healthier, try using just the natural sweetness of ripe mangoes without adding extra sugar or ghee. Eating a small portion (like half a cup) with some protein or a low-GI food like roti is a good way to balance things.",
      "If you have concerns about blood sugar or weight, enjoying it once or twice a week might be helpful. Having a chat with a dietitian could give you even more personalised advice.",

      "These compounds work together and increase apples' antioxidant, disease-fighting, and health-boosting properties.",
      "Dr. Ravleen Sarkaria states, “An apple is a perfect volume-friendly food to eat in a calorie deficit. 86% of a medium-sized apple is water, and it provides 16% of the recommended fibre intake for women. The combination of high fibre and water makes one feel full and satisfied.",

      "Benefits of eating apples for weight loss",
      "Yes, but more in a supportive capacity. Here’s how apples can be helpful in your weight loss efforts:",
      "In a study[2] from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, it was found that apples supported weight loss by lowering harmful fats, reducing inflammation, increasing antioxidant activity, and keeping the metabolism healthy.",
      "In another study[3] from Nutrition Journal, it was seen that the children who ate whole apple or consumed apple products were 30% and 25% less likely to experience obesity.",
      "These studies prove that although eating apples does not directly help you lose weight, they can assist you in doing so. But, they do not directly help burn belly fat.",
      "However, there’s more to apples than just weight loss. Let’s take a look at its health benefits.",
      "An apple a day does keep the doctor away",
      "While most of us eat apples to stay healthy or lose weight, some have found them surprisingly helpful in other ways.",
      "One Reddit user with diverticular disease [when small pouches (diverticula) form in the large intestine wall] reported zero flare-ups since they added apples to their diet.",
      "The best part about eating an apple is that it provides steady energy for quite some time. So this makes it a good option to be eaten:",
      "Apples should be avoided late at night, within 1-2 hours of bedtime, because their fructose and fibre may cause bloating or discomfort in the tummy.",
      "Do you find eating the same raw apple every day too monotonous? Time to make things interesting with these five healthy apple recipes!",
      "Yes, apples are awesome! They are gut-friendly, fibre-rich, and a storehouse of antioxidants. They offer a variety of benefits in a convenient package. What's impressive is how these mechanisms work together to nourish the body.",

      "Aktive offers an approach that uses evidence-based strategies to lose weight without sacrificing your favourite foods or over-stretching your routine.",
      "Try now and see the difference.",
      "Is apple good for diabetes?",
      "Yes, apples have slightly more sugar than others. A medium-sized apple has approximately 19 grams of sugar.",
      "But the good part is that these are not added sugars. They are naturally bound with fibre and water, which slows their absorption in the bloodstream.",
      "Apples are also a low-glycemic index fruit (36-40), which means they don't spike blood sugar levels quickly like other sources of carbohydrates do.",
      "So, while apples contain sugar, their fibre and water content deliver various benefits for diabetics. As long as you eat them in moderation with a balanced diet, you are good to go.",
      "Are apples good for PCOS or thyroid issues?",
      "Yes, apples, with their low glycemic index and high fibre content, are very beneficial in managing insulin resistance and weight problems, which are often seen in women with PCOS.",
      "The antioxidants in apples may also lower inflammation.",
      "When it comes to thyroid issues, apples don't play a direct role.",
      "But they do not contain any goitrogens (compounds that interfere with thyroid hormone production), so you can eat them alright.",
      "Apples are low in calories, so they can easily help you maintain weight.",
      "Is it better to eat apples raw or cooked?",
      "Raw apples are rich in fibre, vitamin C, and antioxidants.",
      "Their fibre content makes it more gut-friendly, satiating, and helps control blood sugar.",
      "But some people may feel bloated or gassy after eating them.",
      "Cooked apples (baked, boiled, or stewed) are a great option for people with dental issues, sensitive stomachs, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Their softer texture makes them easy to eat and digest.",
      "But, heating may decrease the availability of vitamin C, water, and some antioxidants.",
      "Cooking also increases the sugar concentration. This negates the health benefits.",
      "Can apples cause gas or bloating?",
      "Yes, apples can cause gas or bloating in some people, as:",
      "To tackle this issue, you can eat apples in smaller portions, chew them properly, or eat them cooked.",
      "You can also pair them with low-FODMAP foods (e.g. lactose-free yogurt) to balance them out.",
      "Is it okay to eat apples with milk or yogurt?",
      "Yes, apples can be eaten with yogurt or milk.",
      "But yogurt pairs better, as it adds protein and probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health and balancing blood sugar.",
      "Milk is fine too, but it is less beneficial and may cause bloating in lactose-sensitive people.",
      "You can choose to eat apples with plain yogurt or low-fat milk. But do watch for added sugar.",
      "Should I peel apples before eating?",
      "Usually, one should not peel apples before eating. This is because apple skin contains a good amount of vitamins (like A, C, E, and K), minerals, and antioxidants.",
      "Removing the peel can strip away the nutrients.",
      "But, you may need to peel an apple in these instances:",
      "So, eating the apple with the skin intact is okay for most people. But wash the apple well before eating to remove any surface residues.",
      "Which apple is best for weight loss – red or green?",
      "Both green and red apples are nearly equal in terms of their health benefits.",
      "However, green apples are tart than sweet and have more fibre, which can help you manage your blood sugar better and reduce those sweet cravings.",
      "Red apples are slightly sweeter and have anthocyanins (pigments that give them a red colour), which increase their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",
      "If weight loss is your goal, go for green apples more often, but feel free to enjoy red apples in between.",
      "Are apples good for skin and hair health?",
      "Being a good source of vitamins (C, K, and B-complex) and antioxidants, apples repair your skin by producing more collagen and protecting it from free radicals.",
      "However, you must supplement your diet with protein and foods rich in vitamins B and E, selenium, and zinc to strengthen your hair.",
      "Can I eat apples during intermittent fasting?",
      "Yes, you can eat apples during intermittent fasting, but only in your eating window and not in the fasting period.",
      "Apples are the perfect addition to your diet plan as they are low-calorie, high-fibre and micronutrient-rich fruits. This helps you feel full and satisfied for longer periods.",
      "Is it okay to eat apples every day?",
      "According to physician Dr. Santosh Singh, even though apples are good, one must exercise caution while eating them because the fiibre-rich fruit can cause gas and bloating and, when eaten in its raw form, it can increase the risk of foodborne infections in people with low immunity.",
      "Like with all fruits, when it comes eating apples, moderation is key.",
      "Is apple juice as healthy as whole apples?",
      "It's always better to enjoy apples in their whole/raw form, as apple juice lacks fibre and is more sugar-dense than the former.",
      "Whole apples are healthier because they don't spike your blood sugar quickly. Their high fibre content also ensures your gut works properly all the time!",
      "Also, commercial juices have preservatives and additives that lower their positive effects.",
      "Can babies and toddlers eat apples?",
      "Yes, apples are considered safe for babies 6 months or older. As a good source of minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, and fibre, apples help improve digestion and build immunity in infants (and children).",
      "In fact, apples are among the first solid foods babies are introduced to.",
      "They are cooked and pureed so they can be digested easily. Toddlers (1-3 years) can enjoy raw, grated, or thinly sliced apples.",
      "But consult a paediatrician before you get started.",
      "Always introduce apples in small amounts to monitor any allergies or unwanted effects.",
      "Do apples lower cholesterol?",
      "Yes, apples can help lower cholesterol. They contain pectin (a complex carbohydrate), which binds to the bad cholesterol and limits its absorption in the blood.",
      "Being rich in antioxidants, apples prevent the oxidation of bad cholesterol and protect from plaque formation in blood vessels.",
      "Apples vs oranges vs bananas—which are healthier?",
      "We looked into the data (here, here, and here) for a 100g serving of each fruit and have compiled the results for you.",
      "If your goal is:",
      "Can I eat 2 apples a day for weight loss?",
      "Yes, why not? Apples can be a nutritious addition to your weight loss plan. 2 medium-sized apples contain almost 189 calories, which makes a low-calorie snack.",
      "Their high fibre and water content, along with antioxidants, also lend a helping hand in keeping your cravings in check. So you can eat 2 apples daily, but be mindful of the total calories you consume in a day.",

      "Unfortunately, you will end up overeating and, ultimately, hinder your weight loss journey.",
      "Weight loss is not always straightforward[3]. When you have a heavier body, you burn more calories to maintain it. As you lose weight, your body needs fewer calories. This process is ‘metabolic adaptation'.",
      "This can sometimes slow your digestion.",

      "Focus on long-term lifestyle changes instead of temporary diets. Practise mindful eating by listening to your body's hunger and fullness signals. Understand the reasons behind your food choices. Observe how you talk to yourself and manage emotions.",

      "But, there are shortcomings, too, so you should not view CICO as the be-all and end-all solution.",
      "Do not focus solely on calorie numbers. Do not neglect other aspects of healthy eating. Doing so can have the opposite effect in the long run. To get the best of both worlds, combine CICO's formula with holistic lifestyle changes.",
      "Ultimately, the goal is to take care of your mental, physical, and emotional health. This is more effective than just chasing a number on the scale at any cost.",
      "Do you struggle to lose weight",
      "Does the timing of my meals impact the effectiveness of the CICO approach?",
      "Yes, meal timings can influence your food choices, satiety, and digestion. These factors may indirectly impact CICO's effectiveness. However, the total calorie balance over 24 hours matters more.",
      "Can I stick to the CICO method if I have dietary restrictions or preferences?",
      "Indeed. You must adjust your portion sizes according to your dietary restrictions or preferences. CICO is flexible. You can follow it with any eating pattern.",

      "I travel a lot for work. How can I maintain the CICO diet while on the go?",
      "We agree, when you are travelling, CICO diet can go off track. However, you can maintain your calorie intake by planning meals in advance. Or, you can keep yourself hydrated and full with low-calorie drinks when you are on the road.",

      "She states, “When cooked on a non-stick surface with minimal oil, dosa can be relatively low in calories compared to other breakfast options. Opting for smaller-sized dosas or those made with whole grains like oats or millets can further reduce calorie content while increasing fiber intake.”",

      "Dosas can certainly be weight-loss-friendly when you eat them smartly. Portion size matters. And so does what you pair it with.",

      "What is healthier? Dosa or idli?",
      "Both dosa and idli are healthy foods. But when it comes to the carbohydrate content, the scales tilt more in favour of idli. A regular-sized idli contains fewer calories than a regular-sized dosa.",
      "Idlis are steamed and prepared with very little oil. This is especially beneficial for those trying to balance their blood sugar levels and lose weight.",
      "The problem is modern idlis have become more like fluffy rice cakes (thanks to too much rice), while dosas are often fried with excess oil or ghee, which increases the calorie content. So, if you're going low-carb or oil-free, go for idli. And if you need something more filling and crisp, a dosa with minimal oil can be healthy.",
      "Is dosa better than roti?",
      "Both dosa and roti are nutritious and serve different purposes. But roti is slightly better than dosa because it is lower in calories, has more protein and fibre, and has a medium glycemic index.",
      "Dosa, on the other hand, is a fermented dish, which makes it gut-friendly and easy to digest. It is also a good option for those with gluten sensitivity or intolerance. But it contains more calories and less fibre than roti.",
      "The trick is to enjoy them with adequate vegetables and protein sources to get their benefits.",
      "What is millet dosa, and how is it different?",
      "As the name suggests, millet dosas are a spin on the regular dosa where rice is replaced with a millet (kangani, bajra, ragi, jowar or kodo). As millets are whole grains, eating millet dosas ensures you get the following:",
      "How many dosas can I eat on a weight loss diet?",
      "If you are on a weight loss diet, you can eat 1-3 medium-sized, homemade dosas in a meal. They should be prepared in less oil and eaten with high-protein, low-calorie sides like bhurji, vegetable sambhar and mint chutney.",
      "Are instant dosa mixes healthy?",
      "Instant dosa mixes are definitely quick and convenient to prepare. But they may contain additives, preservatives, artificial flavours or excess sodium.",
      "Instead, you can buy fermented dosa batter from the local vendor or the convenience store and prepare them while saving time.",
      "Which dosa is best for diabetics or PCOS?",
      "When selecting a meal for someone with diabetes or PCOS, you need something that doesn't spike blood sugar levels, has adequate protein and healthy fats, and supports gut health.",
      "In such instances, dosas made from millets (e.g., foxtail millet or finger millet dosa), moong dal, and brown or red rice can provide sufficient fibre and essential nutrients.",
      "These dosas are low on the glycemic index, stabilise blood sugar levels and can keep you full. These factors help in losing weight and restoring hormonal balance.",
      "Is masala dosa unhealthy?",
      "The potato filling in masala dosa adds extra carbohydrates and calories, which can make it less healthy. The oil or ghee used to prepare it can increase the calorie count.",
      "Instead, you can use less oil and add more vegetables to the filling to make it healthier. That being said, you can enjoy it occasionally without feeling guilty about it. But do remember to get back on track.",
      "Can I eat dosa at night?",
      "Yes, you can! Just keep it light.",
      "If made the traditional way, with minimal oil and a generous veggie filling, eating a dosa at night won’t mess with your goals. One plain dosa has around 168 calories, which is manageable if you eat mindfully.",
      "That said, dosa is still a high-carb food. Eating too many carbs late at night may slow down your metabolism slightly, especially if you’re inactive or tend to sleep soon after.",
      "What is the best chutney I can eat with dosa for weight loss?",
      "Here are some healthy, low-calorie chutneys you can enjoy your dosas with:",
      "Is fermented dosa batter better than instant dosa batter?",
      "Yes, fermented dosa batter does have an edge, especially when it comes to gut health and nutrition. Fermentation makes dosa easier to digest and also increases the availability of vitamin B and minerals to the body.",
      "Instant batters or quick mixes might save time, but they often skip this natural process. That means you're missing out on those added benefits; in some cases, they can be heavier or less satisfying.",
      "But if you are in a rush, don't worry about eating an instant dosa occasionally.",

      "Frequency",
      "3 times a week",
      "Time spent per session",
      "20 minutes",
      "Exercise routine per session",
      "Now that you have mastered the basic workout routine to get rid of belly fat, why not level up a little bit and try an intermediate workout routine for fat loss?",
      "The exercises in this routine are the same as the exercises in the beginner workout routine, but they are a bit more intense and will give you just the right amount of push to a healthier version of yourself.",
      "Frequency",
      "4 times a week",
      "Time spent per session",
      "30 minutes",
      "Exercise routine per session",
      "If you have aced the intermediate workout routine and have noticed belly fat loss already, it is time to switch to an advanced workout routine to lose more belly fat.",
      "The exercises, once again, stay the same, but they will test your commitment to health and fitness. However, stick to the routine and you will see results like never before. So, are you ready?",

      "Getting a flat stomach is about looking good, feeling your best, and maintaining good health. Try these belly fat loss exercises one by one, and you will see the difference. One day, you will look good in that kurta or saree, and you’ll know, it was all worth it.",
      "To see better, more visible results for belly fat, try the scientifically proven weight loss treatment Aktive and lose up to 10% of your body weight in just six months.",
      "Don't lose heart if you cannot follow all workouts immediately. You simply need to start and keep moving forward. Your body will appreciate every squat, push-up, and burpee you do.",
      "Just like Rome wasn't built in a day, losing belly fat takes time. With consistency, you will experience changes in how you look and feel.",
      "Why should I mix different exercises?",
      "Mixing different exercises every day can make it easier to stick to your fitness plan in the long run. When you mix cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises, you improve your endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance all at once. Combining different exercises can help you lose fat faster. It also reduces the risk of injury by spreading physical stress across various muscle groups and joints.",
      "How often should I do these exercises to see results?",
      "To see the results of your efforts, try to follow these workouts at least 3-5 times a week. The key is to stay consistent and gradually increase the intensity as you progress. As everyone's body is different, so it might take a few weeks to start noticing changes. Pairing your workouts with a healthy diet will help you see results faster.",
      "How can I lose belly fat in a week?",
      "It is not possible to lose belly fat in a week. To dissolve accumulated fat, long-term consistency is key. Exercising at least thrice a week without fail and taking weight loss treatment plans such as Aktive will help you reduce belly fat at home in a healthier way.",
      "How to reduce belly fat without exercise?",
      "Unfortunately, you cannot reduce belly fat without exercise. Unless you follow the CICO method, or the ‘Calories in, Calories out' method, your body will not use the accumulated fat in as energy to survive, and so, there will be no fat loss. You will have to follow a proper exercise routine and eat right to reduce belly fat.",
      "Can I lose belly fat by doing only yoga?",
      "Yoga is great for flexibility, stress relief, and mindfulness. However, on its own, it may not be enough to lose belly fat. You can combine yoga with cardio and strength training to experience the benefits of improved strength and flexibility. These activities burn more calories and help you shed overall body fat, including belly fat.",
      "Is it necessary to go to a gym for these exercises?",
      "No, you don't need to exercise in a gym to reduce belly fat. Most of these can be done at home with little or no equipment. A lot of bodyweight workouts, yoga, and basic cardio can be done from the comfort of your home. If you like using weights or machines, sure, a gym offers more options, but it's not mandatory to be there.",
      "How long will it take to see results from these exercises?",
      "The golden word here is patience. It depends on when you start working out, how balanced your diet is, and how consistent you are. Generally, you might start noticing a reduction in belly fat in 4-6 weeks. Focus on inch loss, don't obsess over the numbers on the scale, and you'll be good to go.",
      "Can I do these exercises if I have back pain?",
      "Yes, but be careful. If you have back pain, always pick the low-impact versions of standard workouts to avoid strain. It's also wise to consult a doctor or physical therapist for personalised advice.",
      "What if I exercise too much?",
      "Overexercising has its pitfalls. In a bid to lose belly fat faster, you might exert too much pressure on your body with too many exercises. But doing so can cause Rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle tissue breaks down and releases kidney-damaging protein due to overexertion.",
      "It is always advisable to exercise only as much as your body allows you to. Listen to your body and know when to stop. Fat loss will happen if you are gradual and committed.",
      "What should I do if I do not lose weight even after exercising consistently?",
      "This is a possible scenario. If you aren't losing weight even after exercising regularly, you might be missing out on key aspects of weight loss, such as diet and rest. Eat right, eat well, and get enough rest to let exercise affect your weight. Your sabzis, dals, chapatis are all good sources of protein, fibre, and vitamins. Eat these foods to see better results.",
      "You might also have an underlying medical issue, such as thyroid, diabetes, or PCOS. Your medicines might also be making you gain weight as a side effect. You should contact your doctor in that case and figure out what exactly it is that is stopping you from gaining weight.",

But the belly fat problem isn't just restricted to fitting into your favourite kurta or trousers."

      "What is BMI?",
      "Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using your height and weight. It tells you whether you're underweight, a healthy weight, or overweight based on your height, age, and gender.",
      "Why do you need a body image?",
      "A body image is required to ensure that you are eligible and so that we can see your progress. We will only ask for you to provide this once every 3 months. The picture will only be visible to you and our partner doctor - no one else will have access to it. We realise it's inconvenient, but it's essential for the safety of our patients and to protect those who are vulnerable.",
      "Do I know immediately if I qualify for treatment?",
      "After finishing the consultation, you will receive a call from an allied healthcare professional to confirm your details. During our working hours, one of our partner doctors will review your answers within 1-2 hours. Outside working hours, you can expect to hear back from us on the following working day. If we have any further questions or are unable to prescribe to you, we will send through a message.",

From then on, you will automatically receive a new supply every 4 weeks. We will always inform you about upcoming shipments.",
      "Which dosage will I receive and why?",

      "How does the dosage increase work?",
      "After 4 weeks of taking the same dose, your body will have adjusted enough for you to increase it. Taking a higher dose means more medicine, and therefore more weight loss progress. You may experience mild side effects every time you increase your dose - this is entirely normal and will subside once your body gets used to the new dosage. If you want to stay on the same dose, this is also possible. Just get in touch.",
      "Do I have to update my medical answers or body image?",
      "It is important to update your medical answers so that our partner doctors can see how you are responding to your treatment plan. New body images will also need to be uploaded on occasion to help track your progress.",

      "Our treatments, available as both tablets and injection, work in five simple ways:",
      "Why is it more effective than other weight loss medications?",
      "Our treatments work on many levels. The active ingredient works by making your body produce more of a specific hormone that affects how hungry you feel.",
      "This slows down digestion and stomach emptying. It affects your appetite because your brain gets the signal \"I'm full' much quicker. Which means you eat less.",
      "The medication also resets your metabolism. You have a set point that your body defends to maintain. It gives you hunger signals if you drop below this point. The hormones reset this point to a lower level.",
      "Our treatments are clinically proven to help you lose weight. They are prescribed with utmost discretion and caution by renowned doctors and specialists - this is something that cannot be said of other weight loss medications.",
      "What are the benefits?",
      "The main benefit of our treatment is that it's proven to effectively cause weight loss.",
      "When combined with a healthy lifestyle:",
      "Losing weight also reduces your risk of developing severe health complications later in life, such as heart disease, high cholesterol and strokes.",
      "How much weight can I lose on your weight loss plan?",
      "How much weight you can lose depends on the individual and is also dependent on factors such as diet and exercise.",
      "However, on average:",
      "How is it guaranteed that the medicines are original?",
      "All our treatments are dispensed by accredited partner pharmacies.",
      "Who can use it?",
      "We can only provide the treatments to individuals with a BMI of 30 and above (or 27 and above with weight-related health conditions). If you meet that criteria, fill out our online medical quiz. One of our partner doctors will then check your medical history and determine if you're suitable.",
      "When do I start seeing results?",
      "Everybody's weight loss journey looks slightly different. However, you will likely start seeing results as soon as one month into treatment. Remember, healthy weight loss takes time and patience.",
      "Do I need to go on a diet?",
      "Yes. For the drug to work, you must make the necessary lifestyle changes to your diet and exercise habits. You should consume fewer calories daily, and make changes to your exercise regime. Most people should exercise 75 - 150 minutes weekly - this could be as simple as walking or doing household chores.",
      "What is the daily tablet?",
      "The daily tablet is a new generation weight loss medication that is taken orally once a day. No need to inject yourself.",
      "How do I take the tablet?",
      "The tablet is taken every morning on an empty stomach. Remember to take it first thing and wait 30 minutes before your first meal or drink of the day.",
      "What dosages are available?",
      "The daily tablet is available in 3 different doses: 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg.",
      "How do I increase dosages?",
      "After 4 weeks of treatment, we will automatically increase your dose (as long as it's been deemed suitable by one of our partner doctors, and you're happy to take the next dosage level).",
      "What if I miss a dose?",
      "If you miss a dose, skip your tablet for that day and wait until the following morning to take another one.",
      "What if I experience side effects?",
      "It's very common to experience mild side effects, especially when you first start treatment and increase your dose. These can be managed with diet - for example, fatty and sugary foods are more likely to cause nausea.",
      "What is the weekly injection?",
      "The injection we prescribe is a prescription-only, once-weekly injection that is used for weight management.",
      "It removes excess sugar from the blood and slows digestion, which makes you feel fuller for longer and lose weight.",
      "How does the injection work for weight loss?",
      "The active ingredient in the injection works in five simple ways:",
      "What should I do before taking the injection?",
      "Here’s what you should do before taking the injection:",
      "How do I prepare the injection?",

      "What are the possible side effects?",
      "Like all prescription medicines, our injection too can cause some side effects. This is especially true during the first few months. However, the most common side effects are mild and go away on their own.",
      "Common side effects include:",
      "Most of these side effects should disappear once your body has gotten used to the medication. However, if you experience any persistent or worrying side effects, speak to us or your healthcare provider.",

      "When your brain sees or smells something tempting, it remembers how good it felt last time and activates your reward system by releasing dopamine (the ultimate pleasure-seeking hormone). This pushes you to eat that food again, even if you're full.",

      "But they wear off fast, making your brain depend on them just to feel okay.",
      "More sugar means more dopamine for the brain. Also, the acidic taste of carbonated drinks leaves you feeling 'refreshed.'",
      "In reality, the high sugar content of these drinks draws more water from the body and leaves us thirsty.",

      "There are a variety of reasons why you might crave sweets even after enjoying a full meal:",
      "What does craving fried food mean?",
      "If you are craving fried foods, there’s more to it than the crunch. Your body likely needs healthier fats, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), and omega-3 fatty acids.",
      "Sometimes, these cravings may also manifest because of a lack of sodium, carbohydrates, and zinc. Dehydration, stress, and lack of sleep can also increase these cravings.",
      "Can my gut bacteria make me crave junk food?",
      "Shockingly, yes! More and more research[1] indicates that the harmful bacteria inside our gut secrete chemicals similar to hunger hormones.",
      "These hormones signal the brain to crave processed or unhealthy foods so the bacteria can feed themselves. To avoid this, hydrate well and eat more fermented and fibre-rich foods.",

      "When distracted, we tend to eat more and for as long as that particular OTT content or sports event is live, even if the body isn't truly hungry.",
      "To manage this issue, you can prepare healthy snack bowls in advance, keep a water bottle nearby, and ask yourself if you are willing to eat an apple. If not, then you can skip eating during that time.",
      "Do food cravings mean I’m not eating enough?",
      "Many times, yes.",
      "When you don't eat enough, your body is pushed into a \"survival mode.\" So, it starts craving quick energy boosts in the form of sugar, carbs, salty, or high-fat foods.",
      "Eating balanced and nourishing foods with enough protein, fibre, and healthy fats can prevent you from bingeing.",
      "Is it okay to give in to cravings sometimes?",
      "Yes, it is alright to indulge occasionally. In fact, it keeps you away from feeling deprived and prevents you from binge eating later.",
      "Do food cravings mean I’m pregnant?",
      "Although pregnancies are famous for their intense and unusual ‘cravings,’ they are not the only sign of pregnancy.",
      "A visit to the gynaecologist can help you confirm whether you are pregnant.",
      "Can smelling food make you crave it more?",
      "Yes. The smell of food is a big trigger for your appetite as it can bring back memories of pleasurable eating experiences.",
      "This is why certain smells like those of freshly baked cookies, fried snacks, or homemade meals can intensify your cravings.",

      "Here, the ovaries end up having many tiny fluid-filled sacs (or cysts) form on their outer part. These sacs hold immature eggs (follicles).",
      "Now, normally, ovaries release an egg every month.",
      "But in PCOS, things change.",
      "You might have lots of estrogen but no egg to release. As many follicles don’t fully grow, they end up messing up the menstrual cycle.",
      "While more research is needed to understand the cause of PCOS, a major reason can be insulin resistance (the body’s inability to use insulin properly).",

      "Issues like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and trouble falling asleep share PCOS as a common factor.",
      "These problems affect the good restorative sleep you deserve and worsen hormonal imbalances. Even healthy women with a normal BMI can face this issue.",
      "It turns out that the “sleep on it” approach may be helpful in managing PCOS.",
      "Experts recommend sleeping for 7-9 hours to balance your insulin, cortisol, and hormones that control hunger and energy.",

      "This is why sugary foods top the PCOS food list to avoid.",
      "Also, birth control pills (often prescribed for PCOS treatment) can make cravings worse.",

      "If you are thinking about intermittent fasting (IF) to manage PCOS, it may be worth your time.",
      "IF is a method of eating where you create windows of eating and fasting and alternate between them.",
      "This way, your body uses stored fats instead of glucose and enters a “fat-burning mode.”",
      "The Jain community in India has been engaging in intermittent fasting since centuries. The aim when doing an upvasa is to increase self-control, detach yourself from unhealthy eating habits, and detox your body.",
      "Not just that, Ayurveda[9] often compares PCOS to Santarpanajanya Vikara (diseases due to excess). For this, Upvasa (fasting) can help balance and improve Agni (digestive fire).",
      "Intermittent fasting can improve insulin sensitivity, lower androgens (male hormones), and help lose weight.",
      "In one study, almost three-quarters of women with PCOS started getting their periods again after just 6 weeks of time-restricted eating (IF)!",
      "However, not all studies show clear benefits.",
      "A study[10] carried out on women with PCOS fasting during Ramadan didn't see any major changes in insulin or glucose levels.",
      "Still, the approach can work for some, especially when intermittent fasting is tailored to their needs.",

      "Following these simple steps in this guide will help you manage PCOS and stay on track.",
      "This may seem like a lot at first, but you don't have to implement all these changes at once. Just start small, choose one or two tips that seem doable, and slowly add them to your routine. With time, these habits will work in auto-pilot mode.",

      "How can a PCOS patient lose belly fat fast?",
      "Quick weight loss may look good on paper, but doing so may have negative effects on your health. To reduce belly fat, it’s best to follow a healthy and sustainable weight loss strategy, including calorie restriction and a mix of cardio, strength training exercises, and yoga. As spot reduction is not possible, the flat belly you desire is only possible after consistent full-body workouts.",
      "Try to lose a steady 0.45-0.91 kg every week.",
      "How do you treat skinny PCOS?",
      "Unlike popular belief, PCOS affects lean/skinny women too. Like obese PCOS, treating skinny PCOS focuses on managing symptoms, staying active, stress control, and eating a healthy, balanced diet.",
      "Instead of restricting calories, lean women should focus on maintaining their current weight. Doctors recommend eating plenty of fruits and vegetables to get essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. These habits help improve insulin sensitivity and lower androgen levels that may cause symptoms.",
      "Can I drink milk in PCOS?",
      "Truth be told, the answer varies from person to person. Some women with PCOS find that dairy products, including milk, can worsen their symptoms due to their effects on insulin and androgens.",
      "On the other hand, others tolerate dairy just fine. If you enjoy milk, drink it in small amounts and see how it affects your body. Alternatively, you can drink almond or oat milk. Your doctor or nutritionist can help you make the right choices.",
      "Can medications for PCOS help with weight loss?",
      "Along with lifestyle changes, medications too can help PCOS patients lose weight. Drugs like metformin, orlistat (which helps block fat absorption), and GLP-1 receptor agonists (a relatively new addition) can be used under medical supervision.",
      "Some women may also benefit from medications like spironolactone or birth control to manage symptoms. So, it’s best to get a complete lab workup followed by a consultation with your doctor to find the right medicine that suits you.",
      "What is seed cycling, and can it help with PCOS?",
      "A relatively new concept, seed cycling involves eating specific seeds during different phases of the menstrual cycle. This helps balance estrogen and progesterone levels.",
      "However, more research is needed to support its effectiveness in managing PCOS.",
      "Are there any supplements that can help with PCOS weight loss?",
      "Today, the market is flooded with supplements like inositol, vitamin D, and magnesium (sulphate, citrate, glycinate, etc.). These are designed to help with insulin resistance and correct hormone levels (which have an indirect effect on weight loss).",
      "However, the extent of benefits from these supplements may be different for different people. So always consult your doctor before you get started.",
      "How to reduce ovary size in PCOS?",
      "Doctors use a variety of treatments to reduce the ovarian size in PCOS. It involves:",
      "If the above approaches aren’t successful, some doctors may recommend laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (a procedure that involves creating small holes in the ovarian tissue to reduce the production of male hormones and re-establish ovulation) as a surgical option.",
      "Can a woman with PCOS get pregnant?",
      "Hormonal issues and irregular ovulation in PCOS can make conception more challenging. As many as 5 to 10 per cent of women with PCOS around the world are affected by infertility. But they can successfully become pregnant and have healthy babies. It might take more planning and some medical assistance but don't lose hope.",
      "If you're trying to conceive, consult your doctor before you start planning and work on changing your lifestyle in gradual, positive ways.",
      "Is PCOS a serious problem?",
      "Untreated PCOS can progress to different health complications like:",
      "But, with proper care and management, women with PCOS can lead healthy and fulfilling lives.",
      "Can I live a long life with PCOS?",
      "Yes, why not? While you cannot reverse PCOS, and it does increase the chances of contracting some health conditions, it is completely possible for women to manage their symptoms with regular check-ups, holistic lifestyle changes, and stress management.",

      "For example, you can make the batter for moong dal chilla, roast nuts, oats, or makhanas beforehand and store them in the freezer for a few days.",
      "Cutlets, paneer fillings, sprouts, and dry-roasted ingredients can be frozen as well.",
      "On rushed mornings, you can put together a sprouts salad, ragi porridge, or a quick chilla in under 10 minutes.",
      "Are these breakfast recipes suitable for diabetics?",
      "Most of these breakfast recipes can easily fit into a diabetic-friendly diet because they use whole grains, high-fibre ingredients, and good sources of protein.",
      "These help keep blood sugar steady instead of causing quick spikes.",
      "Moong dal chilla, oats upma, and ragi porridge are especially helpful because they have a lower glycemic index.",
      "If you have diabetes, it is advisable to consult with your doctor or dietitian and monitor portion sizes carefully.",

      "Many Indian recipes use gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, millet (ragi, jowar, or bajra), or quinoa.",

      "Can I skip breakfast and still lose weight?",

      "However, be careful while adding them to your breakfast, as they are easy to overeat and high in calories.",
      "Which is better for weight loss, oats or poha?",
      "Oats are nutrient-rich and contain more protein (10-13g) and fibre (10-11g) per 100g.",
      "This makes them more filling and helps control hunger. Their low glycemic index makes it easier to stabilise blood sugar levels.",
      "Poha, on the other hand, is light and easy to digest, with 130-150 calories per 100g.",
      "However, it contains less protein (2.5-3g) and fibre (1.5-2g) and may leave you hungry sooner.",

      "That’s alright! You can try ginger - just make kadak adrak chai - it will help relieve gas and bloating. If chai is not your cup of tea, you can try turmeric - add a teaspoon in your milk and see how digestion disappears. And then there’s saunf (fennel seeds).

      "I do not like chilled jeera water. For how long can I store it at room temperature?",
      "Jeera water is a fresh drink. This means, you should not store it at room temperature for more than a few hours. If you do not like chilled jeera water, consume it at room temperature on the same day. Otherwise, its effectiveness will start to wane.",
      "I do not want to lose weight and my digestion is fine. Can I still drink jeera water?",
      "Yes, you can still drink jeera water if your weight is under control and you can easily digest food. The simple drink helps in many other ways as well. It boosts the immune system, improves skin health, regulates sugar levels, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and detoxifies the body.",

      "We have sent a passcode to above number. Please enter your code.",
      "If you are starting Mounjaro (Tirzepatide), chances are you're feeling hopeful and confused at the same time.",
      "It's easy to wonder, “Am I doing this right?”",
      "We’re here to help you figure out just that.",
      "Like most medicines, Mounjaro works best when its dosage is increased gradually.",
      "But how much Mounjaro should you actually take?",
      "This guide walks you through the standard Mounjaro dosage chart along with some useful lifestyle tips that will help you adjust more comfortably to the medication.",
      "The only drug in its class, Mounjaro, is a dual-action drug that activates two hormones in the gut: GLP-1 and GIP. It is approved for weight loss treatment in India and is available as a once-weekly injection.",
      "When injected correctly, Mounjaro does the following:",
      "Because this mechanism affects multiple organs, the body often needs time to adapt to it.",
      "That’s why your doctor will get you started on the lowest Mounjaro dose and gradually increase the dosage over the next few weeks.",
      "This helps you adjust gently to the weight loss medicine with reduced side effects.",
      "Doctors prescribe Mounjaro at the lowest, safest dose, i.e., 2.5 mg. The doses are usually increased every four weeks.",
      "About your dosages:",
      "Here is a typical Mounjaro dosing schedule doctors usually follow.",
      "Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice:",
      "At your next checkup, talk to your doctor about how you're feeling on both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses. Your progress so far will help them decide if you should increase your dose further.",
      "Everyone’s weight loss journey is different — and so is your Mounjaro dose. Your doctor will start you on a small dose and slowly adjust it depending on how your body reacts.",
      "They’ll look at things like:",
      "There’s no rush. The goal is to find the dose that suits your body best, helps you lose weight safely, and keeps you feeling well throughout the journey.",
      "One of the best and most useful ways to understand how your body responds to changes, be it medication, diet, or exercise, is tracking.",
      "You can simply enter your daily glucose readings, weight, and any side effects experienced in a diary. If fitness apps work for you, give them a go!",
      "A written record of your response to dose changes can also help your doctor monitor your health.",
      "This way, you play a more proactive role in taking charge of your health and maximising your doctor appointments.",
      "When you cannot take your dose within four days of the scheduled injection, it is counted as a missed dose. However, there is no need to panic if this happens. Here’s what you can do:",
      "You can take one dose on any day shown in the ‘missed dose’ row. If it’s a day, skip the dose and wait for your next regular dosing day.",
      "To change the day of taking the medication, keep a gap of at least three full days, or 72 hours, between the two doses.",
      "Sometimes, the body needs more time to adjust to a particular dose of Mounjaro. Certain situations may warrant you to lower your dose or pause it altogether:",
      "Always keep your doctor in the loop. Even small updates can help them support you better.",
      "Also read: Side effects of Mounjaro and how to manage them",
      "Adapting to any new medication, especially one that affects your appetite and glucose metabolism, takes some time. But with these small changes, you can adapt to the new dose better:",
      "The Mounjaro dosage chart has been carefully designed while keeping your safety, comfort, and health goals as the top priority. Some people see results early, while others take a little longer.",
      "And that’s okay.",
      "You just need to be consistent and patient and work closely with your doctor to find the dose that works best for you.",
      "What is the best time of the day to take Mounjaro?",
      "The good thing about taking Mounjaro is that you don’t have to worry about taking it before or after meals. This doesn’t affect how well it works.",
      "The key is to choose a time that’s easiest and most convenient for you to remember. This helps you stay consistent with your doses and stick to your schedule. So to make things easier, take it on the same day and at the same time every week.",
      "What if I accidentally take the wrong dose?",
      "If you take a higher dose than prescribed, contact your doctor immediately. Mild overdose may cause nausea or vomiting, but a severe overdose requires urgent medical attention.",
      "Can I split my weekly dose into smaller doses?",
      "No. Mounjaro is designed and prescribed to be taken once a week only. Splitting the dose can reduce its effectiveness and increase the chances of side effects.",
      "Does the dose affect how fast I lose weight?",
      "Not always. Weight loss depends on how your body responds. Some people lose more weight on lower doses, especially when combined with lifestyle changes.",
      "Will increasing my dose reduce my hunger even more?",
      "Yes. Increasing the dose may increase the suppression of appetite. This is because GLP-1 and GIP activity is increased, which sends stronger ‘fullness signals’ to the brain.",
      "Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro?",
      "You can take alcohol while on Mounjaro, but only in moderation. Heavy drinking can aggravate the side effects and pose a risk to your overall health. Consult your doctor to know more.",
      "Can I inject Mounjaro at a different time each week?",
      "Ideally, it is preferable to take Mounjaro on the same day and time each week.",
      "But if you do need to change your injection day or time, maintain a gap of at least 72 hours from the previous dose.",
      "How do I know if the medication is working?",
      "Monitor your weight, appetite, and energy to understand if Mounjaro is actually working for you.",
      "If the medicine is working, you will experience less cravings, more energy, and eventually, weight loss. Your blood pressure and blood sugar levels will stabilise.",
      "How long should I stay on Mounjaro?",
      "The length of treatment with Mounjaro depends on your health goals. You may need to take this medication anywhere from six months to several years.",
      "For example, people with type 2 diabetes may need to take Mounjaro long-term to manage blood sugar levels.",
      "For weight loss and maintenance, your doctor will guide you on when and how to stop taking Moujaro gradually and safely.",
      "Can I stop Mounjaro for a month and restart where I left off?",
      "When it comes to any medication, especially Mounjaro, it’s best to consult your doctor before stopping or restarting it after a break.",
      "You may need to restart at a lower dose, like 2.5 mg, rather than resuming your previous dose. This is because your body’s tolerance to the medication may decrease during the break. Jumping back to a higher dose could increase the risk of side effects.",
      "Your doctor will evaluate your current health status, treatment goals, and any changes in your condition and decide the safest way to resume Mounjaro.",
      "How do I administer my dose correctly?",
      "For Mounjaro to work properly, it’s important to inject it safely and hygienically.",
      "Check out this step-by-step guide on how to inject Mounjaro properly so you can get the most out of it with fewer chances of post-injection complications.",
      "How do I manage Mounjaro side effects?",
      "Some people experience side effects in the first few weeks of taking Mounjaro. These effects are seen as a result of increasing the dose.",
      "The milder effects, like nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc., are usually temporary and get better with time.",
      "If you wish to manage Mounjaro side effects, here are some things you can try:",

      "Mounjaro’s active ingredient, Tirzepatide, is a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor as well as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.",
      "For the unversed, GIP is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and metabolism. It encourages fat reduction and prevents fat accumulation, helping you manage weight.",
      "GLP-1, on the other hand, is a hormone in the body that regulates appetite and insulin production. The hormone curbs hunger and makes you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage calorie intake.",
      "Tirzepatide mimics these hormones and works in five simple ways:",
      "Mounjaro is finally available in India. So, of course, the first question that comes to mind is: Does Mounjaro really help lose weight?",
      "The answer is - Yes, it does!",
      "In fact, several studies have shown that Mounjaro is a revolutionary weight loss injection that can help people tackle obesity with ease.",
      "In a study[1] published in Nature Medicine, involving 579 obese adults (with an average weight of 109.5 kg) who were given Tirzepatide over 12 weeks, results showed:",
      "This study clearly shows that Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) can help people lose a significant amount of weight in a short period.",
      "We have now established that Mounjaro helps people effortlessly lose weight. However, can anyone who considers himself/herself overweight or obese take the weight loss injection in India?",
      "No.",
      "Mounjaro is a prescription-only weight loss injection. This means you need a doctor’s prescription to take it for weight loss. This also means that your doctor should find it reasonable to prescribe Mounjaro to you.",
      "If you meet any or all of the below conditions, you are eligible to take Mounjaro:",
      "Be careful, though. You might not be eligible to take Mounjaro if you have any or all of the following medical conditions:",
      "Inform your doctor if any or all of the following apply to you before taking Mounjaro:",
      "Unlike other weight loss injections such as Wegovy and Ozempic, it is very easy to take Mounjaro for weight loss.",
      "Mounjaro is a once-weekly weight loss injection. This means you have to take Mounjaro only once a week.",
      "You can take Mounjaro on any day of the week, and any time of the day. But, ensure that you take Mounjaro on the same day, at the same time every week.",
      "Mounjaro comes in multiple dosages - starting from 2.5 mg and going upto 15 mg.",
      "The usual Mounjaro dosage is as follows:",
      "*After keeping you on 5 mg for 4 weeks, your doctor may decide to keep you at 5 mg or increase your dosage to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg. This depends on whether you are meeting your weight loss goals and if the medicine is working well for you.",
      "About your dosages:",
      "If you miss a dose of Mounjaro, do the following:",
      "Pro tip:",
      "Worried you might miss your Mounjaro dose? Set a weekly reminder on your phone and never miss a dose again.",
      "Taking Mounjaro injection for weight loss is a pretty easy process.",
      "In India, Mounjaro is available as a pre-filled injection pen (KwikPen).",
      "Before you inject yourself with the medication, make sure the pen is working well.",
      "Mounjaro weight loss injection in India comes with special storage and disposal instructions.",
      "Here is how to store Mounjaro the right way:",
      "Here is how to dispose of Mounjaro the right way:",
      "Like all medicines, Mounjaro has its own side effects. Most of these side effects are mild and rare, and they go away on their own with time.",
      "These are some of the most common side effects of Mounjaro that you should look out for:",
      "Other adverse reactions to Mounjaro include:",
      "If Mounjaro's side effects do not go away on their own or get worse, get immediate medical attention.",
      "Nausea can disrupt day-to-day life. Here are some ways you can manage nausea while taking Mounjaro:",
      "Mounjaro weight loss injection works best when it is taken alongside a balanced diet and routine exercise. This is why, it is very important to make the following lifestyle changes when you take Mounjaro for weight loss in India.",
      "Not quite. Weight loss injection Wegovy has been approved for use in India in June 2025.",
      "Around the world, Ozempic and Zepbound are available as weight loss injections for those struggling with obesity. Ozempic was approved in India in December 2025, but Zepbound has yet to receive approval in India.",
      "Are Mounjaro and Wegovy the only weight loss medicines available in India?",
      "No. There is Rybelsus. Manufactured by Novo Nordisk, Rybelsus is approved in India as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but its active ingredient, Semaglutide, also leads to weight loss.",
      "However, Rybelsus is not approved for weight loss in India.",
      "Yes.",
      "Aktive offers a weight loss programme, designed for Indians looking to lose weight without going through complicated fad diets, intense workout routines, and haywire schedules.",
      "With Aktive’s clinically-proven weight loss treatment, you can lose upto 21% of your body weight within a year.",
      "Mounjaro is here. Weight loss is no longer a distant dream for those struggling with obesity and type 2 diabetes.",
      "But Mounjaro is not magic. You can inject it with all your might, but without a good diet and the right exercise, you will most likely not see results.",
      "To sum it up, Mounjaro is a means to an end, and not the end goal itself.",
      "But at least, India can take a step forward and defeat obesity with Mounjaro.",
      "That’s news worth celebrating.",
      "How long does Mounjaro take to work?",
      "Mounjaro starts working right after the first dose.",
      "However, if you are wondering about the timeline for weight loss after starting Mounjaro, it is different for different individuals.",
      "Some people may notice they are losing weight with Mounjaro earlier than expected. For others, Mounjaro may take time to show its effect due to various factors such as diet, exercise, age, and health conditions.",
      "Contact your doctor if you are not losing at least 5% of your body weight within one year of starting Mounjaro.",
      "Does Mounjaro interact with any other medicines?",
      "Yes. Mounjaro can interact with other medicines you are currently taking and vice versa. These include diabetic medicines such as sulfonylureas or insulin, medicines such as warfarin, or oral hormonal contraceptives.",
      "What should I do if I am taking oral hormonal contraceptives before starting Mounjaro?",
      "If you are planning to start Mounjaro, but are taking oral hormonal contraceptives, talk to your doctor about it.",
      "Your doctor may switch you to a non-oral contraceptive method or advise you to use a barrier method such as a condom for 4 weeks after starting Mounjaro and for 4 weeks after every change in dosage.",
      "Can I change the day of the week for taking Mounjaro?",
      "Yes, you can change the day of the week initially scheduled for taking Mounjaro. However, it is important to keep a gap of at least 3 days or 72 hours between two Mounjaro doses.",
      "Can Mounjaro cause pancreatitis?",
      "Yes, in some patients who were treated for obesity with GLP-1 medicines, acute pancreatitis has been observed. Mounjaro is no exception.",
      "However, your doctor will monitor you for signs of pancreatitis after starting Mounjaro. These signs include: severe stomach pain, pain that can radiate to the back, and vomiting.",
      "If you notice any such signs, inform your doctor. In case of pancreatitis, your doctor may ask you to discontinue Mounjaro.",
      "Can Mounjaro cause hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels?",
      "Yes, one of the side effects of Mounjaro can be hypoglycemia, which means blood sugar levels have dropped.",
      "Signs of hypoglycemia include: dizziness or light-headedness, sweating, blurred vision, irritability or mood changes, slurred speech, shakiness, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, feeling jittery, increased heart rate, etc.",
      "If you notice any such signs, monitor your blood sugar levels immediately and contact your doctor.",
      "What if I do not have a sharps container to dispose of Mounjaro injection pen?",
      "If you do not have a sharps container for disposing of Mounjaro injection pen, you can use a normal household container. But make sure that the container is made of heavy-duty, durable plastic, has an air-tight lid that doesn’t allow needles to fall off from the container, and is leak-resistant.",
      "Should I use my Mounjaro injection pen if I see air bubbles in it?",
      "Air bubbles are normal. You can use your Mounjaro injection pen even when you notice air bubbles. You might also see a drop of liquid at the tip of the needle during priming the pen. This is normal too. But, under any circumstances, do not touch the needle.",
      "I heard more than 2 clicks while using my pen. What should I do?",
      "Sometimes, you may hear three clicks while using the pen - two loud clicks and one 1 soft click. The soft click may occur before the second loud click. This is normal. Do not remove the pen from the skin until you hear the second loud click.",
      "What if I feel my pen has not worked the right way?",
      "If you feel your Mounjaro pen is not working the right way, contact our customer support team for further instructions.",

      "Some people feel completely at ease while taking Mounjaro. Others may feel tired, nauseous or off-balance before things settle. But knowing what to expect and when to reach out for help can make all the difference.",
      "We hope this guide gives you the information you need so you can have a more open conversation with your doctor about Mounjaro.",
      "Yes, side effects are real, but are also manageable in most cases. You don't have to tough it out alone.",
      "Aktive connects you with doctors, nutritionists, and real people who understand the ups and downs of this process.",
      "Should I stop taking Mounjaro if I have side effects?",
      "Not necessarily. Mild side effects are expected and often temporary. However, if you’re experiencing persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, mood changes, or signs of dehydration, it is best to stop and consult your doctor immediately.",
      "Are Mounjaro side effects worse at higher doses?",
      "They can be. Each dose escalation may bring back or intensify symptoms like nausea, fatigue, or digestive upset. That’s why gradual increases, as per your doctor’s advice, are important.",
      "Does everyone experience side effects from Mounjaro?",
      "No, side effects vary from person to person. Some people experience minimal discomfort, while others may struggle during the first few weeks. Factors like diet, other medications, and medical history influence your experience.",
      "Does Mounjaro cause hair loss or thinning?",
      "Hair loss isn't listed as a known side effect of Mounjaro, but some users have reported it anecdotally. This might be due to rapid weight loss, calorie restriction, or nutritional deficiencies. If you notice excessive hair fall, do check with your doctor.",
      "Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro?",
      "Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects like nausea and low blood sugar, more so in people with diabetes. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol, especially when you have just started out. Always ask your doctor what’s safe for you.",
      "Can side effects change from dose to dose?",
      "Yes. Even if you tolerated a lower dose well, side effects may reappear briefly when your dose is increased. That’s why titration (gradual increase) is built into most Mounjaro regimens.",
      "Can I take Mounjaro if I have IBS or other gut issues?",
      "Caution is advised. Mounjaro may worsen GI symptoms like bloating, constipation, or diarrhoea — especially in people with IBS, IBD, or a history of gut sensitivity. Discuss your condition with your doctor before starting it.",
      "Is it safe to take Mounjaro during your period or if you have PCOS?",
      "There’s no evidence that Mounjaro worsens menstrual symptoms.",
      "In fact, for women with PCOS, weight loss and insulin sensitivity improvements may support hormonal balance. However, consult your gynaecologist if your periods become irregular or heavier while on Mounjaro.",
      "Can Mounjaro cause weight loss that's too fast or unhealthy?",
      "Yes, some people may lose weight more quickly than intended, especially if they’re unable to eat enough due to nausea or appetite suppression.",
      "But rapid weight loss can lead to fatigue, hair thinning, or muscle loss. If you're losing more than 1–1.5 kg per week, you may need to talk to your doctor or dietitian about adjusting your food intake.",
      "Can I take over-the-counter medicines to help with side effects?",
      "Some people use remedies like antacids, fibre supplements, or anti-nausea meds — but always check with your doctor before combining anything with Mounjaro. Drug interactions are possible.",
      "Can I take Mounjaro while pregnant?",
      "It’s best not to take Mounjaro during pregnancy. At present, there isn’t enough data on how safe it is for pregnant women. Animal studies have shown possible harm to the baby, such as developmental issues.",
      "If you find out you’re pregnant while on Mounjaro, stop taking it right away and speak to your doctor about further course of action.",
      "Can I take Mounjaro while breastfeeding?",
      "Mounjaro isn’t recommended if you’re breastfeeding.",
      "There are no studies in humans yet. While animal studies show that the drug might pass into breast milk, we’re not sure how it affects babies. It’s safest to check with your doctor for better alternatives to manage your health during this time.",
      "How can I manage Mounjaro side effects during weddings or festivals?",
      "Adjusting to Mounjaro might be slightly tricky during festivals, but here is how you can enjoy worry-free:",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do the side effects go away over time?",
        "answer": "The good news is that most people who take Mounjaro gradually adapt to the side effects, especially the common gastrointestinal ones. These usually last for 3 months and get better as the body learns to adjust. But this can be different for different people."

        "question": "Practical tips to feel better while your body adjusts",

So to prevent that, your diet should include more of protein like fish and chicken. Among the vegetarians, you have pulses, paneer, soya, and tofu.”"

      "We have sent a passcode to above number. Please enter your code.",
      "Without further ado, most people on Mounjaro can see changes in their weight within 4 - 8 weeks. The most significant changes in weight are seen between 9 and 26 weeks.",
      "According to a clinical trial[1], people can lose up to 21% of their starting body weight after 72 weeks.",
      "Watching the scale move for the first time, fitting into old jeans, or finally feeling good when you look in the mirror—we know, you too, want the same.",
      "With a weight loss drug like Mounjaro now available in India, you can finally turn your weight loss dreams into a reality.",
      "But we know what’s causing that hesitation. Before taking Mounjaro, you want to know if it is worth it. You want to know how long it will take to see the results.",
      "We have the answer.",
      "The 72-week SURMOUNT-1 trial[1], done on 2,539 adults with obesity, weighing 104.8 kg on average, showed the following results:",
      "Key Finding:",
      "Higher doses correlated with greater weight loss. On the 15 mg dose, 57% of participants achieved ≥20% body weight reduction",
      "85% participants lost ≥ 5% weight",
      "89% participants lost ≥ 5% weight",
      "50% participants lost ≥ 20% weight",
      "91% participants lost ≥ 5% weight",
      "57% participants lost ≥ 20% weight",
      "In comparison, people on a placebo lost only about 3% of their body weight on average.",
      "Yes, weight loss is possible with Mounjaro. The studies prove it. But what changes can you expect with every new dose?",
      "Your answer is just a scroll away.",
      "Weeks 1 to 4: The start (2.5 mg dose)",
      "Weeks 5 to 8: The shift (5 mg dose)",
      "Weeks 9 to 12: Building momentum (5 mg - 7.5 mg dose)",
      "Weeks 14 to 26: The optimal dose (10 mg - 15 mg dose)",
      "Weeks 27+: Maintenance (optimal dose)",
      "Even when two people take the same dose, eat similar foods, and start on the same day, weight loss can still look very different.",
      "Many factors affect this, including:",
      "Starting weight:",
      "In the initial stages of the weight loss journey, you will lose weight quickly.",
      "The closer you are to your healthy weight, the slower your weight loss becomes.",
      "Why this happens",
      "Your body starts to sense weight loss as a threat and begins to conserve energy to protect itself.",
      "Age:",
      "When we are younger, we tend to lose weight quickly. But the pace of weight loss slows down as we continue to age.",
      "Why this happens",
      "Hormones, metabolism, and muscle mass naturally decline with age.",
      "This leads to slower calorie burn and weight loss.",
      "Diet and activity:",
      "A healthy, protein and fibre-rich diet, paired with physical activity, helps you lose weight steadily.",
      "Why this happens",
      "A healthy diet stabilises hunger hormones and blood sugar, which is the ideal environment for weight loss.",
      "Daily habits:",
      "Poor sleep, chronic stress, alcohol, or smoking can make cravings stronger and slow down weight loss.",
      "Why this happens",
      "These negative habits spike ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and cortisol (the stress hormone).",
      "So you feel hungry more often and burn fewer calories.",
      "Medical history:",
      "Conditions like PCOS, hypothyroidism, or insulin resistance can slow progress.",
      "Why this happens",
      "These conditions can disturb your hormones and slow your metabolism, which makes weight loss harder.",
      "The scale isn’t the only way to measure success. Sometimes your body is making changes you can’t see in numbers, yet.",
      "Look for these signs:",
      "Keep a log or take monthly photos. Small changes over time add up, and seeing them can help you stay motivated during plateaus.",
      "You notice you are not losing weight on Mounjaro. This could be because:",
      "If the scale isn’t moving, don’t panic. It doesn’t always mean the medicine isn’t working.",
      "Sometimes, a few changes are all you need.",
      "Mounjaro works. The evidence proves it. But the most important thing is to know that the timeline may be different for everyone.",
      "Some may see quick results, while others may need more time. Both are normal.",
      "The scale shows just one part of your weight loss. If you notice your sleep, energy levels, and the way your clothes fit have improved, it is a victory!",
      "The best results are achieved when you pair Mounjaro with a balanced diet, regular physical activity, good sleep habits, and effective stress management.",
      "In weight loss, consistency matters far more than speed.",
      "Looking for weight loss that is safe, effective, and easy to maintain?",
      "Your search ends with Aktive.",
      "We understand that losing weight takes more than just willpower.",
      "That's why our weight loss plans are guided by doctors, designed around your routine, with support whenever you need it.",
      "No restrictive diets. No intense workout schedules.",
      "Just pure weight loss, right from the comfort of your home.",
      "Will I lose weight faster if I start with a higher Mounjaro dose?",
      "Starting on a higher Mounjaro dose will not help you lose weight faster.",
      "In fact, it is not recommended that you start Mounjaro on a higher dose at all, since the initial doses are designed to help your body adapt to the medicine.",
      "Once your body settles in, higher doses of Mounjaro can help. Just give it time and stay consistent.",
      "When will I start to notice a decrease in appetite on Mounjaro?",
      "Most people using Mounjaro notice a reduction in appetite within 1-2 weeks of starting the medication. You, too, might see the same.",
      "You may feel less hungry, crave less junk food, and consume fewer calories within a couple of weeks after taking your first dose.",
      "Why is my weight loss slow after the first few months on Mounjaro?",
      "It’s normal for weight loss to slow down after the first few months of taking the medicine.",
      "This is because your body is still adjusting to your new weight. This does not mean Mounjaro isn\"t working.",
      "Just give your body time to process the drastic changes, and keep your diet and exercise steady. It gets better eventually.",
      "What can I do to accelerate slowed progress on Mounjaro?",
      "Weight loss plateau (stalled weight loss) is common as your body adjusts to a new weight. Here\"s what you can do to tackle it:",
      "Will I gain weight back after stopping Mounjaro?",
      "You might regain some weight after stopping Mounjaro, especially if you return to old eating and activity habits.",
      "This is because stopping the medication reverses its effects on hunger and blood sugar.",
      "Maintaining lifestyle changes is important even after discontinuing Mounjaro to keep the weight off.",
      "What kind of exercises can I do while on Mounjaro, especially in the first few weeks?",
      "Gentle movements can actually make the first few weeks easier.",
      "When you start Mounjaro, you may experience some nausea or fatigue, so begin slowly.",
      "A 15 to 20-minute walk is enough for the first four weeks to support your progress.",
      "As your body settles and you move into the next six weeks, you can increase the intensity.",
      "Strength training, cycling, swimming, or simple home workouts are all effective options.",
      "Exercise helps you lose weight steadily and protects your muscle mass while you lose weight.",
      "Consult your doctor before starting any new regimen.",
      "Is it normal to not lose weight in the first 4 weeks on Mounjaro?",
      "Yes, it is completely normal. . The first four weeks (at 2.5 mg dose) are all about getting your body used to the medication.",
      "Some people even gain a little in this phase, and that is okay.",
      "Most people notice more visible weight loss between weeks 5 and 8, as the dose increases to 5 mg and appetite suppression improves.",
      "Use this first month to build healthy lifestyle habits. These set the foundation for the results that follow.",
      "How long should I stay on Mounjaro for weight loss?",
      "It varies.",
      "According to research, participants continued to lose weight throughout the 72-week study period, which is approximately 17 months.",
      "But the timeline isn’t set in stone.",
      "Your doctor will assess your progress, including:",

      "“How do I manage fatigue, digestion, or sleep on Mounjaro?”",
      "If you’ve started taking Mounjaro or are seriously considering it, chances are you’re hoping for more than just a number on the scale to change.",
      "You want to feel fewer food cravings, more energy, and better control over your health.",
      "However, people often miss one thing. Mounjaro is a powerful tool for weight loss. But how much you lose and how you keep it off depends on what you do alongside it.",
      "And that’s where lifestyle plays a major role.",
      "In the sections ahead, you’ll find some practical lifestyle tips to follow while taking Mounjaro for weight loss.",
      "Although Mounjaro can affect your appetite, what you choose to eat still matters.",
      "Colourful sabzis, home-cooked meals, whole grains, etc., will take you further than a packet of chips.",
      "Eat foods rich in protein, fibre, healthy fats, and micronutrients, so your body gets what it needs even when you're eating less.",
      "You don’t need to hit the gym or sign up for a fancy fitness class. When you're on Mounjaro, even small amounts of movement can result in:",
      "Drinking water may sound like simple advice. But it matters when you're on Mounjaro",
      "Since Mounjaro slows down your digestion, you might deal with side effects like constipation, bloating, or nausea.",
      "And not drinking enough water can make these issues worse. If you have diabetes, dehydration can interfere with your blood sugar levels, which is the last thing you need.",
      "Learn more about managing Mounjaro’s side effects.",
      "If you're not sleeping well, you may be undoing all your hard work.",
      "Even if you're eating right, not getting your daily dose of quality sleep can lead to fat gain and muscle loss.",
      "Staying up late and eating late can confuse hunger hormones (ghrelin, leptin, and GLP-1). This leads to fat storage over time. But sleeping well can reverse these effects.",
      "In fact, a study[1] showed that increasing your snooze time by one hour can reduce daily calorie intake by 270 calories.",
      "Stress can heavily sabotage weight loss.",
      "Whenever people feel distressed, they tend to gravitate to comfort foods. This can include anything from sweets and chocolates to fatty and fried foods.",
      "This happens because stress increases cortisol levels[2] in the body. As a result, your appetite for high-fat and sugary foods increases significantly.",
      "Want to know more about different food cravings and how to manage them easily? This guide will help.",
      "The best part about setting realistic goals is that you don't have to overhaul everything overnight.",
      "Did you know that your family has an equally important part to play in your weight loss?",
      "While taking Mounjaro, you will need to stay in touch with your doctor periodically to ensure the medication is working as planned.",
      "Regular check-ins with the doctor are a valuable way of catching any issues in time.",
      "Ever since its release in India, Mounjaro has revolutionised the science of weight management.",
      "Mounjaro is a highly effective solution for your weight loss problems. But its success is largely dependent on your lifestyle.",
      "Balanced eating, regular activity, good sleep, hydration, stress management, alongside a strong support system, are the pillars of long-term success with Mounjaro.",
      "But you need to be patient. Realistic targets and consistent efforts will get you farther than any dose of motivation ever can. With time, these habits will feel like second nature.",
      "Can I eat sweets while taking Mounjaro?",
      "Yes, you can, but in moderation. Sweets may reduce the blood sugar and weight-loss benefits of Mounjaro.",
      "However, you can occasionally enjoy small portions of low-sugar options, such as fresh fruit or dark chocolate (with 70% or higher cocoa content).",
      "Try to pair your sweets with protein, fibre, or nuts (like some berries with Greek yoghurt) so you can balance those post-meal sugar spikes.",
      "How can I manage nausea while taking Mounjaro?",
      "It is common to experience gastrointestinal side effects with Mounjaro. Nausea is one of them.",
      "To tackle nausea, eat small, frequent meals with bland, easy-to-digest foods such as biscuits, dals, soups, and rice.",
      "Avoid greasy, fatty, or spicy foods. Sip water or ginger tea throughout the day to calm your stomach. If nausea persists, contact your doctor as soon as possible.",
      "Can I drink alcohol while on Mounjaro?",
      "Moderate alcohol consumption may be okay for some, but for others, it can affect blood sugar and increase the chances of side effects.",
      "Sometimes, alcohol may also interact with Mounjaro and affect its beneficial action.",
      "You can stick to low-sugar options, such as dry wine or spirits with zero-calorie mixers. However, always consult your doctor before trying anything new.",
      "How do I know if I’m eating enough protein on Mounjaro?",
      "Try to eat 1.2–1.6g of protein per kg of body weight daily (for example, 80–100g for a 70 kg person). This will help you preserve your muscle mass.",
      "To ensure you get this much protein, try including a variety of protein sources, such as sprouts, dals, nuts, whole grains, paneer, eggs, chicken, fish, tofu, etc., in every meal.",
      "What if I miss a dose?",
      "If you miss a dose of Mounjaro, do the following:",
      "Should I follow a specific diet, such as the keto diet?",
      "There’s no one-size-fits-all diet for Mounjaro. However, studies have shown that calorie restriction is beneficial.",
      "A balanced, nutrient-dense diet with vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean protein works best.",
      "Keto may be too restrictive and isn’t necessary for Mounjaro. But if you’re considering it, consult a dietitian to ensure it meets your nutritional needs and aligns with Mounjaro’s effects.",
      "Will I regain weight after stopping Mounjaro?",
      "You may regain some weight after stopping Mounjaro, especially if you don't continue healthy habits.",
      "However, you can surely prevent weight regain if you stay active, eat well, get enough sleep, and manage stress properly.",
      "If you, however, do plan on stopping the medication, doing so under medical supervision with a proper step-down plan in place will be helpful.",
      "What can I do if I feel low on energy?",
      "Feeling low on energy can happen for a few reasons. With Mounjaro, it’s often linked to things like dehydration, eating too little, or missing out on essential nutrients.",
      "To feel better, try this:",
      "If you still feel tired, it's best to speak to your doctor. They can check for any deficiencies or side effects that may be causing the fatigue.",
      "Does Mounjaro affect my cholesterol levels?",
      "Yes, Mounjaro may have a positive effect on cholesterol levels.",
      "In fact, studies have shown that people taking Mounjaro have experienced reduced levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. In some cases, HDL (good cholesterol) levels improved.",
      "These benefits are likely due to the combined effects of weight loss, better blood sugar control, and improved insulin sensitivity. However, results can vary from person to person.",
      "If you already have high cholesterol or are on cholesterol-lowering medication, make sure to regularly monitor your levels.",
      "Also, keep your doctor informed about any latest developments in your health.",
      "Can I take supplements while on Mounjaro?",
      "Some supplements, like multivitamins or fibre, may be beneficial to your health.",
      "However, some supplements may interact with Mounjaro and affect its effectiveness.",
      "Always consult with your doctor before starting any supplements, so you know they’re safe and necessary for your goals.",
      "How do I know if my lifestyle changes are working with Mounjaro?",
      "We often tend to obsess over the changing numbers on the weighing scale. However, this is not the only metric we should focus on.",
      "To see if your lifestyle changes are working, track non-scale metrics, such as improved energy, mood, or blood sugar readings.",
      "Notice how your face looks or how your clothes fit. Are there any changes in your waist circumference?",
      "Note your progress monthly, and see the difference.",

      "India is the diabetes capital of the world. 7.7 crore Indians aged 18 and above are suffering from type 2 diabetes. 2.5 crore Indians are on the verge of becoming diabetic. Even more alarming is that over half of the population is unaware of their blood sugar levels.",
      "Being a diabetic increases the chances of severe health issues. This includes stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, and blindness.",
      "With such health concerns on the rise, managing type 2 diabetes has become more crucial than ever. This is where Ozempic offers a ray of hope. Hailed as the most revolutionary ‘anti-diabetic’ injection by experts worldwide, Ozempic is now considered the ultimate solution for diabetics.",
      "But Ozempic’s benefits don’t end there. In addition to helping diabetics control their blood sugar levels, it also targets weight loss.",
      "This article will explain how Ozempic works. It will also elaborate on the benefits of managing diabetes and how it helps with weight loss.",
      "Ozempic, with semaglutide as its active ingredient, is an injection that mimics the action of GLP-1, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. It is used to treat diabetes. However, it is also prescribed off-label for obesity.",
      "The FDA first approved Ozempic for diabetes in 2017.",
      "Ozempic works in multiple ways within the human body. The infographic below clearly explains how the injection positively affects health. It improves not just blood sugar but also the digestive system, body weight, and insulin sensitivity.",

      "In a clinical review report[1], researchers looked at the change in body weight over 30 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes. These patients hadn't taken medication before and weren't managing their blood sugar well with only diet and exercise. Some participants were given 0.5 mg semaglutide, some were given 1 mg semaglutide, and the rest were given placebo.",
      "In the same study, researchers measured the change in A1C levels (last three months’ average blood glucose levels) over 30 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes who hadn't taken medication before. Here too, some participants were administered 0.5 mg semaglutide, some were given 1 mg semaglutide, and the rest were placed on placebo.",
      "After 30 weeks, they found that semaglutide 0.5 mg and semaglutide 1 mg doses helped the participants lose significantly more weight and manage their A1C levels more considerably when compared to placebo.",

      "A study[3] was published in December 2023. It was noted that GLP-1 medicines, such as Ozempic, reduced colon cancer rates among type 2 diabetics. 18,518 diabetic people who took GLP-1s had a 25% reduction in colorectal cancer compared to 18,518 diabetic people who took metformin.",

      "These tried and tested tips will help you ensure that poha helps you lose weight in the best way possible:",
      "In a study[1], researchers asked 100 people with diabetes to eat poha daily for 6 days while continuing with their usual diet and medicines. They measured the patients' blood sugar levels on days 1 and 7.",
      "What they found was that the patient's blood sugar levels were lower than before. This was mainly possible because of its fibre content and low glycemic index.",
      "Therefore, the study proved that poha can be a cost-effective way to manage blood sugar levels, which also have a huge role to play in weight loss.",
      "Poha can be a misunderstood food staple. Here are four poha myths that you should be aware of.",
      "Poha Myths: True or False?",
      "Test your knowledge about common poha myths!",
      "1. All flattened rice varieties are exactly the same as poha .",
      "Different varieties of flattened rice exist across Asia, each with unique processing methods. Examples include Pinipig (Philippines), Ambok (Odisha), Mont Hsan (Myanmar), Khao Mao (Thailand), and Cốm (Vietnam).",
      "2. poha is universally easy to digest for everyone.",
      "While poha is generally easy to digest, some people with sensitive guts may have issues. Adding heavy spices, fats, nuts, or soya can also affect digestibility.",
      "3. Poha always causes stomach aches.",
      "Poha typically aids digestion due to its fiber content. Stomach issues may occur due to improper rinsing, specific ingredients, individual sensitivities, or pre-existing conditions.",
      "4. poha can completely replace vegetables in your diet.",
      "While nutritious, poha cannot replace vegetables entirely. Vegetables provide essential vitamins (A, C, K), minerals, folate, diverse fibers, phytochemicals, and antioxidants that poha alone cannot provide.",
      "Healthy eating doesn't have to be boring, and poha proves that. It is a great example of how something simple and affordable can be a healthy weight-loss meal. Be it the regular kande pohe, or the hatke poha chilla, you can whip up your delicacy without compromising on flavour or satisfaction.",
      "Swap out the high-calorie ingredients, follow portion control, try eating one poha dish a week, and then switch it up. You will not regret it.",
      "For more deets on weight loss, healthy eating, and easy to do workouts, follow Aktive. Explore how you can lose upto 10% of your body weight in 6 months with clinically proven weight loss plans by Aktive.",
      "Can I eat poha while dieting?",
      "Yes, poha is an excellent meal choice for weight loss due to its low-calorie count (110-354 kcal/100g), high fibre, and complex carbohydrates. Together they help you sustain energy for longer periods of time without spiking blood sugar. It is a versatile ingredient and can be easily combined with different vegetables, protein sources, and nuts to help you with your weight loss goals.",
      "Is poha better than rice?",
      "Yes. poha is a healthier alternative to rice, the reasons behind this being:",
      "What are the disadvantages of eating poha?",
      "While poha can be weight-loss friendly when taken in moderation, it also has some disadvantages.",
      "Is poha a junk food?",
      "No! On the contrary, poha is a wholesome dish rich in fibre, carbohydrates, iron, vitamins, and minerals. It is best to eat homemade poha with adequate protein and vegetables so you get the best of its nutritional value.",
      "Can poha help in gaining weight?",
      "It depends on how you prepare poha , how much you eat, and what you eat it with. Adding calorie-dense foods like peanuts, nuts, seeds, potatoes, or extra oil can cause unhealthy weight gain. Some believe that adding grated coconut or serving it with curd can also increase its calorie content.",
      "Is poha gluten-free?",
      "Poha is flattened/flaked rice that does not contain gluten, as it is made from white and red rice. This makes it a complex carbohydrate and a convenient option for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.",
      "How does poha compare to oats for weight loss?",
      "Oats are nutrient-rich and pack more protein (10-13g) and fibre (10-11g) per 100g. This makes them more filling and helps control hunger. Their low glycemic index makes it easier to stabilise blood sugar levels.",
      "poha , on the other hand, is light and easy to digest, with 130-150 calories per 100g. But it contains less protein (2.5-3g) and fibre (1.5-2g) in comparison and may leave you hungry sooner. So, pick oats if you are looking for satiety and poha if you want a quick, light meal.",
      "Is poha suitable for people with diabetes?",
      "Definitely, because of its low glycemic index (38-64) and high fibre content, poha slows down the absorption of carbohydrates. This way, the sugar levels in the blood rise slowly and steadily, rather than in sudden spikes. You can prepare poha with minimal oil and add more veggies and protein to increase its nutritional value.",
      "How do I store poha, and what is its shelf life?",
      "As a dry food item, poha has a good shelf life of around six months to a year. Always try to store poha in airtight containers in a moisture-free, cool place to prevent mold and pest attacks. Check for a fresh smell, insects, etc., before you use poha .",
      "Can I prepare poha in advance?",
      "Yes, you can save time while cooking poha . For this, you can chop the vegetables and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator. This way, you only need to soak the poha before cooking and temper it with spices.",
      "Also, you can make your poha premix at home by roasting the poha , and then mixing it with spices, peanuts, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. Cool the mixture completely before storing it in an airtight container. Cooked poha can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days, but it’s best to enjoy it fresh.",
      "Is poha a complete meal on its own?",
      "Although poha is a low-calorie, nutritious meal, it still cannot compensate for our daily requirements of proteins, fats, and some other nutrients on its own. Combining it with healthy vegetables, legumes, or dahi can increase its nutritional value.",

      "Aktive’s weight loss programme offers a simple, science-backed way to lose weight without compromising your diet.",
      "How much protein do I need per day?",
      "The recommended daily protein intake varies by age, gender, and activity level.",
      "For maintenance purposes, adults need about 0.8–1g of protein per kg of body weight. So for a 60kg person, that's 48–60g daily.",
      "However, if you're active, trying to lose weight, or build muscle, you may need 1.2–2g of protein per kg of body weight.",
      "Eating healthy protein sources like soya can help you meet a significant portion of this requirement. 100g of boiled soya provides 18g protein, which is about 30–40% of most people's daily needs.",
      "Does soya cause weight gain?",
      "No, soya itself doesn't cause weight gain. Like any food, how much you weigh depends on your eating habits and calorie intake. In fact, soya is relatively low in calories while being high in protein. This way, it keeps you full longer.",

      "However, you must consult your doctor about adding soya to your meal plan.",
      "What's the difference between soya chunks and soybeans?",
      "Soybeans are the whole bean in its natural form (raw or boiled).",
      "Soya chunks, on the other hand, are made from high-protein, low-fat soy flour by removing oil from soybeans and then shaped into chunks.",
      "Protein content:",
      "Both soybeans and soy chunks are nutritious options, but soy chunks have a higher protein concentration.",
      "Can men eat soya? Does it affect testosterone?",
      "Yes, men can safely eat soya.",
      "There’s a huge myth that soya messes with men’s hormones, but studies show this isn’t true.",

      "To avoid side effects:",
      "If you experience persistent digestive issues, reduce your intake or consult a healthcare professional.",
      "Is soya suitable for children and teenagers?",
      "Yes, soya is safe and nutritious for children and teenagers when consumed in age-appropriate amounts. It provides them with protein, calcium, and iron, which are essential for the healthy development of the brain and body.",
      "Choose whole soya foods, such as milk, tofu, or boiled soybeans, rather than processed soya supplements.",
      "If your child has any allergies or health conditions, consult a paediatrician before introducing soya regularly.",
      "Is soya gluten-free?",
      "Yes, soya is naturally gluten-free. Pure soya products like soybeans, tofu, soya milk, and edamame contain no gluten. This makes them safe for people with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity.",
      "However, be cautious with:",
      "Tip: Look for \"certified gluten-free\" labels when buying packaged soya products.",
      "Many product labels also indicate whether the food item was processed in a facility that also processes allergens such as peanuts, tree nuts, soya, wheat, or dairy.",

      "Rybelsus 14 mg, Rybelsus 7 mg, and Rybelsus 3 mg are almost like miracle pills that help obese Indians get rid of obesity and type 2 diabetics in India get their blood glucose spikes under control - all with just one single tablet daily for 12 months. But, does it come with its terms and conditions? Read on to know more.",
      "Tej Mahboobani, a 35-year-old hospitality professional, had to constantly be on his toes for long hours at work. Breaks were small and infrequent. So, whenever Mahboobani managed to find some time to eat, he would grab a fried, processed snack to munch on. The result was disastrous. Mahboobani began to weigh 116 kg. Soon, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. If he didn’t do anything soon, he would end up with diabetes - and things would just go downhill from there on.",
      "Thankfully, he found out about Rybelsus - an oral form of semaglutide. Within months, Mahboobani managed to cut down his weight from 116 kgs to 99 kgs.",
      "In an interview with The Indian Express, Mahboobani says he can now, “walk an hour every day, squeeze in 15 minutes of exercise, snack on salads, have dinner by 7 pm and sleep by 10 pm.” This is the magic Rybelsus brings to life.",
      "But what exactly is Rybelsus? How does an oral tablet help people lose weight and manage their glucose levels? Isn’t this too good to be true? Read on to find your answer.",
      "Rybelsus is the oral form of semaglutide. It is prescribed for type 2 diabetes management. The FDA approved it in 2019. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation approved Rybelsus in India in 2022 for managing type 2 diabetes. It is currently available in three dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg.",
      "Even though Rybelsus is approved to manage type 2 diabetes, since it helps people lose weight simultaneously, doctors do sometimes prescribe it ‘off-label’ for weight loss as well.",
      "Semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Rybelsus, is a GLP - 1 receptor agonist. Don’t let the phrase put you off. GLP-1 is a hormone that naturally occurs in our bodies.",
      "This is what it does in our body:",
      "GLP-1 hormone signals the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar levels rise. This moves sugar into the cells to generate energy.",
      "The hormone slows down the pace of the movement of food through the stomach. This results in feeling fuller for longer after eating.",
      "The hormone decreases sugar production in the liver when it is not required.",
      "GLP-1 also affects the areas of the brain that control appetite. As a result, you end up feeling less hungry.",
      "Semaglutide mimics this hormone in the body, eventually resulting in type 2 diabetes management and weight loss.",
      "Rybelsus works exactly the same way as semaglutide - it makes the pancreas release more insulin, stops the liver from producing too much sugar, signals the brain to eat less, and slows down gastric emptying.",
      "This simple function of the medicine has helped millions of people worldwide and in India become healthier versions of themselves within a year.",
      "People are already seeing dramatic changes in weight after taking Rybelsus. One Reddit user from India shared his complete weight loss journey with Rybelsus. In his own words, Rybelsus, which was prescribed to him ‘off-label’, has worked wonders for him.",
      "He shares, “I have not done any exercise yet. I have not completely cut down on sugar either. It [Rybelsus] has really been a life changer for me since I have been struggling with my weight for a very long time. Just so you know, I was not diabetic or prediabetic before.”",
      "We know, you want to know, how much weight you can really lose safely and effectively with Rybelsus.",
      "It is tough to find out, as Rybelsus isn’t approved for weight loss in India.",
      "But you can surely find out how much weight you will lose with Aktive’s safe and clinically proven weight loss programme. Use our weight loss calculator below to know more.",
      "Our treatment plans have proven to result in 15% weight loss in one year. Curious as to how much you could lose?",
      "In India, Rybelsus is proving to be a game-changer. The country currently has 7.7 crore type 2 diabetics. The number will only continue to rise.",

      "Currently, a generic version of Rybelsus is not available because the medication is protected by patents. The tablet form of semaglutide is unique. Hence, generics cannot be made until the patent expires.",
      "Is Rybelsus available without a prescription?",
      "No, Rybelsus is a prescription-only medication. You need a valid prescription from a licensed doctor to purchase it from both local and online pharmacies.",

      "Introducing GLP-1 medicines, a revolutionary path to successful and lasting weight loss. Available as daily tablets or weekly injections, scientists have found that what was once just a diabetes medication could in fact be a cure for obesity. Keep reading to learn about the science of GLP-1 and why the results are so effective.",
      "GLP-1 drugs refer to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, also known as GLP-1 analogues or incretin mimetics.",
      "You may have heard of brands like Wegovy ,Ozempic, or Rybelsus, made popular by Hollywood and Bollywood celebrities. These are GLP-1 treatments (containing Semaglutide) that can accelerate your weight loss journey by affecting your hunger levels and your metabolism.",
      "GLP-1 medicines must be used long-term, in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, in order to achieve maximum results. Many people choose to take them in tablet form so as to avoid self-injection and because it’s quick and easy. However, it is also possible to inject GLP-1 agonists once per week.",
      "Over time, you slowly increase the dosage level, giving your body plenty of time to adjust. Higher doses of GLP-1 offer greater weight loss results.",
      "Positive side effect diabetes",
      "Originally, GLP-1 agonists were created to treat diabetes. People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood, and GLP-1 drugs help by increasing incretin hormone levels that stimulate insulin production. Insulin is required to bring blood sugar levels down, by letting sugar become absorbed from the blood into nearby cells.",
      "Testing effect on digestion",
      "When testing the effect of GLP-1 agonists, it was also discovered that they reduced the rate of digestion and slowed down stomach emptying. This caused a decrease in appetite and led many trialled patients to lose weight.",
      "Approved for weight loss",
      "It wasn’t until many years of further testing that the first GLP-1 drug was approved for the treatment of weight loss in obese individuals. It has since worked to help thousands of people across the globe achieve their weight loss goals.",
      "GLP-1 drugs work to aid in weight loss by doing several different things. They work by:",
      "Suppressing your usual appetite:",
      "Your body naturally produces GLP-1 hormones (such as glucagon) in the small intestine. They are responsible for sending your brain the signal that you are full. GLP-1 drugs mimic these naturally occurring hormones by binding to the GLP-1 receptor hormones in the brain. This results in increased feelings of fullness.",
      "Slowing down gastric emptying:",
      "GLP-1 also acts on the stomach and slows down the rate at which it empties its contents into the small intestine. This delayed gastric emptying can help you feel full longer after eating, reducing the frequency of meals and snacks.",
      "Regulating blood sugar:",
      "GLP-1 drugs have a glucose-lowering effect by enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and inhibiting glucagon release. When blood sugar levels are better controlled, it can reduce cravings for high-calorie, sugary foods, which aids in successful weight loss.",
      "GLP-1 treatments have been thoroughly researched and studied since they were released in the 2000s.",
      "One study taken on just under 2,000 obese people (with a BMI of 30 or above) showcases the effectiveness of the drug. It was a double-blind trial, meaning that neither the patients nor those conducting the study knew who was taking the GLP-1 treatment, and who was using a placebo. The trial took place over 68 weeks.",
      "Results found that:",
      "In kilos, on average:",
      "Patients taking Semaglutide lost significantly more weight than those taking the placebo drug - up to 15% of their original body weight.",
      "Semaglutide is available in the form of daily tablets or weekly injections. The type of treatment you use is usually down to preference.",
      "The following table outlines the key differences between these two types of GLP-1:",
      "GLP-1 treatments are not a quick fix. In order for weight loss to be healthy and sustainable, it needs to be slow and steady. There is no miracle cure that will make you lose weight overnight.",
      "That being said, you’re likely to start noticing results after the first couple of months of treatment. You know your body best, so you’ll be the first to notice that your clothes are slightly looser, or that parts of your body have decreased in size.",
      "More significant weight loss takes place when you’ve been on treatment for at least six months. This is because, you’ll have stayed in a calorie deficit for a prolonged amount of time, and you’ll have had ample time to increase your semaglutide dose.",
      "Once you reach the maximum maintenance dose, you’ll notice that you’re progressing faster than ever in your journey towards better health.",
      "Taking higher doses means that there’s more of the treatment in your system. More GLP-1 means less appetite and fewer calories consumed, which means more weight loss.",
      "Semaglutide is available in different doses:",
      "It is critical that anyone who starts taking GLP-1 treatment begins on the lowest possible starting dose. Your body needs time to adjust to a new medication - beginning on a higher dose comes with risks.",
      "Every four weeks you can increase your dose to the next level up. Your body needs ample time to adjust to the treatment so as to limit your chances of side effects.",
      "It’s very important not to increase your dose sooner, or to skip dosage levels. In this case, your body will not respond as it should. You’ll likely suffer from adverse gastric side effects that may disrupt your progress or put a halt to your weight loss journey altogether.",
      "The main benefits of taking GLP-1 medication are weight loss and lower blood glucose levels.",
      "Weight loss itself has multiple health benefits, including a lowered risk of:",
      "Many of these conditions can become life-threatening.",
      "By aiding in successful weight loss, GLP-1 treatments can improve your long-term health and reduce your chances of developing serious weight-related health conditions.",
      "While taking GLP-1 is the first step towards achieving your weight loss goals, you do need to implement certain diet and lifestyle changes in order to get the most out of your treatment.",
      "It’s important to focus on choosing healthy foods in order to gain the required nutrients from your diet. Eating three chocolate bars a day won't suffice, even if you’re remaining in a calorie deficit.",
      "Doing exercise on a regular basis will also help you get the most out of your treatment. We recommend that you do roughly 30 minutes of cardio or weight training two to three times per week. Feel free to start slower and gradually build your fitness levels up.",
      "GLP-1 drugs work effectively for the majority of people who use them. However, there are always exceptions.",
      "If Semaglutide isn’t working for you, it may be a sign that your body doesn’t respond to this type of treatment. It’s unlikely, but it can happen.",
      "Alternatively, Semaglutide might not work if you experience side effects that are unmanageable. Most people suffer from mild nausea or gastric issues at the start of treatment, before their bodies have had time to adjust. After this period, the side effects subside.",
      "However, some individuals are not as lucky. They might experience severe side effects throughout treatment, ultimately causing them to give up on GLP-1.",

      "But not sure how the dosage schedule works?",
      "Let us help you out.",
      "Wegovy is available in five different doses. But, why is that?",
      "Titrating, adjusting the dose, too quickly can result in intense side effects and might make you discontinue the medicine.",
      "This guide will help you understand how the Wegovy dosage schedule works, why going slow is better, and when (or if) it’s time to move up.",
      "Developed by Novo Nordisk, Wegovy is a once-weekly injection designed to help you lose weight. Its active ingredient, Semaglutide[1], mimics the action of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone, which plays an important part in controlling appetite and managing insulin levels.",
      "What this means is:",
      "Wegovy was approved in India in June 2025 for chronic weight management in people who are overweight or obese. Unlike daily pills or strict diets, it’s taken as a once-weekly injection, which makes it more manageable for many people.",
      "Like Wegovy, another medication known as Mounjaro works by mimicking not just GLP-1, but also GIP for better results. See how Mounjaro helps you lose weight.",
      "You will begin taking Wegovy at its lowest dosage - 0.25 mg.",
      "Your dosage will be increased every month.",
      "This gradual increase helps your body adjust to the medicine.",
      "As you progress, your doctor will decide how long to keep you on a particular dose based on how well you are doing.",
      "Here is a typical dosing schedule doctors usually follow:",
      "Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice.",
      "Here’s what you can expect to see in the coming weeks when you start taking Wegovy:",
      "Although 2.4 mg is the maximum dose for Wegovy, many respond well at a lower dose. Your dose may be maintained or escalated based on clinical results and your comfort level.",
      "Your weight isn't the only factor that decides how much Wegovy you need. When prescribing Wegovy, doctors also evaluate the following things:",
      "The reason behind doing so is to find the lowest effective dose so that you can lose weight without feeling worse. Some people stay on a lower dose long-term, and that’s perfectly okay.",
      "In case you miss your dose, do the following:",
      "Less than 2 days (48 hours) away:",
      "Don't take the missed dose. Take your next dose on your regular scheduled day. Do not take a double dose to make up for the lost one.",
      "More than 2 days (48 hours) away:",
      "Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.",
      "More than 2 weeks (14 days) have passed:",
      "Wait for your usual injection day, or check with your doctor before restarting. They’ll guide you on whether to continue or adjust your schedule.",
      "In case you need to change your injection day, make sure there’s a gap of at least two days between doses.",
      "Since Wegovy works by altering your gut hormones, appetite, and insulin response, it can cause some unwanted effects.",
      "Nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, and vomiting are among the most common side effects of Wegovy.",
      "You’ll likely feel side effects of Wegovy early on or when your dose increases. But most of them are mild and disappear with time as your body adjusts to the medicine",
      "It can take some time to get used to a medication, especially one that affects your appetite and blood sugar levels. But with these small changes, you can adapt to the new dose better:",
      "Your doctor may advise to pause, delay, or reduce your Wegovy dose in the following situations:",
      "If you’re unsure about a side effect, missed a dose, or are planning surgery, fasting, or pregnancy, talk to your doctor first before you make a decision.",
      "Use a diary or a tracking app to record your daily weight, mood, energy levels, and any symptoms you experience. These records can help your doctor adjust your dose.",
      "Everyone experiences weight loss differently. Some people see visible weight loss at a lower dose, while others may need to use the highest dose of Wegovy. What's important is that your body tolerates the dose safely and shows results.",
      "With the right support and a little patience, you can see progress beyond the weighing scale.",
      "Launched in India in June 2025",
      "Wegovy is available in India in the form of a pre-filled injection pen (FlexTouch). You can either self-inject it or take it with the help of a healthcare professional.",
      "Can I increase my Wegovy dose faster if I'm not experiencing any side effects?",
      "Even if you feel completely fine, don’t skip ahead. Each 4-week stage is designed to help your body’s GLP-1 receptors adapt slowly and safely. Rushing doses can trigger sudden side effects or reduce how well the treatment works later.",
      "Will I regain weight if I stop Wegovy after reaching my goal?",
      "Yes, there is a risk of weight regain[2] if lifestyle habits aren’t in place. But with the right guidance, gradual dose reduction, and adequate lifestyle + diet changes, it’s absolutely possible to maintain your progress, even without staying on the highest dose forever.",
      "Can my doctor customize my dose schedule differently from the standard plan?",
      "Yes. The standard Wegovy dosage schedule is a general guideline. It is flexible to an extent, and your doctor may adjust it based on your current health and how your body responds to the medication.",
      "For instance, someone might remain at 0.5 mg for 8 weeks, while another patient may stabilise at 1.0 mg for maintenance. Trust your doctor’s judgment. They’ll adjust your dose to keep it both safe and effective for you.",
      "What if I feel nothing after the first few doses of Wegovy?",
      "Don’t worry, this is normal. The initial 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg doses are meant to help your body adjust. Most people notice effects like appetite control or weight loss from 1.0 mg onwards. Your doctor will guide the pace.",
      "Why do side effects come back each time I increase the dose?",
      "This is completely normal. With every dose increase, your body is introduced to a higher level of Semaglutide, so it needs time to settle again. It’s common to experience mild nausea, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits for 3-10 days before they subside.",
      "These symptoms tend to settle on their own as your body gets used to the new level. That’s exactly why the dose increases are spaced out to help you adapt gradually",
      "I'm losing weight well on 1.0 mg. Do I still need to increase to higher doses?",
      "Not always. If you’re losing weight steadily, tolerating the 1.0 mg dose well, and are happy with your progress, your doctor might choose to keep you there. The idea is to find the smallest dose that still helps you progress.",
      "Can I go back to a lower dose if the side effects become too uncomfortable?",
      "Yes, it’s possible. If you experience ongoing nausea, vomiting, or other strong side effects after moving up to a higher dose, your doctor might bring you back to a lower dose for a few more weeks.",
      "Sometimes, staying at a lower dose for some weeks helps your body adjust before switching to a higher dose. And for some people, that’s the right long-term dose.",
      "Just don’t adjust your dose on your own. Always check with your doctor first.",
      "Why does the schedule require 4 weeks at each dose level? Can this timing be adjusted?",
      "The 4-week gap is there for a reason. It lets your body adjust to the new dose and prevents side effects. Still, it’s not a one-size-fits-all rule. If you're struggling with side effects, your doctor may keep you at the same dose for 6–8 weeks instead.",
      "I've missed 3 weeks of Wegovy. Do I need to restart from 0.25 mg?",
      "Not always. Resuming your previous dose can be slightly tricky. After a gap of more than two weeks, your body loses some of its tolerance to the medicine. Your doctor will usually restart you at a slightly lower dose, and bring you back up to a higher dose gradually.",
      "The ramp-up will be quicker this time, but still under your doctor’s supervision. Never restart on your own.",
      "What should I do if I accidentally inject a higher dose than prescribed?",
      "If this happens, even if you don't feel any symptoms right now, let your doctor know immediately.",
      "Accidentally injecting a higher dose, such as 1.0mg instead of 0.5mg, can trigger intense nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or low blood sugar.",
      "Keep monitoring how you feel, and don’t take your next scheduled dose until your doctor advises. They’ll guide you on the safest way to restart.",
      "Can I stay on the starting dose of 0.25 mg if I see good results?",
      "Though 0.25 mg is technically a treatment dose, it is intended as a starting point to help you adjust. It keeps side effects low while your system learns to handle the medicine.",
      "If you’re already seeing results on 0.25 mg, that’s good, but the progress may not last. Your doctor will likely guide you to increase the dose gradually so you get better results.",
      "My weight loss has plateaued at my current dose. Should I ask my doctor to increase the dose?",
      "Not necessarily. Weight loss plateaus are common and happen for a few reasons:",
      "Before increasing your dose, your doctor will look at:",
      "In many cases, small lifestyle adjustments work better than dose changes. Your doctor will guide you based on your current health status.",
      "Do all patients have to reach the maintenance dose of Wegovy?",
      "Not necessarily. While 2.4 mg is the full maintenance dose, not everyone may need to take it. Some people may see good results at a lower dose (this is especially true if they experience side effects at higher levels). Your doctor will help you find the dose that works best for your body.",

This weight loss injection has arrived just in time, as obesity is becoming one of the topmost causes of disease and death around the world.

      "Wegovy is a once-weekly injection used for weight loss and weight management. Its active ingredient is semaglutide, a GLP-1 mimicking ingredient that the FDA approved in 2021. Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical manufacturer, manufactures Wegovy. Apart from Wegovy, Novo Nordisk also manufactures the anti-diabetic drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus, which are made from semaglutide, the same active ingredient as Wegovy.",
      "Wegovy’s active ingredient, semaglutide, works by mimicking a hormone in your body called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1). This is what GLP-1 hormone does in your body:",
      "GLP-1 hormone signals the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar is high. It helps move sugar into cells for energy.",
      "The hormone slows down the movement of food through your stomach, making you feel full for longer after eating.",

      "GLP-1 affects the areas of the brain that control appetite. As a result, you feel less hungry.",

      "But, as with every other medicine, it is important to note that Wegovy is not a miracle drug that can replace a healthy diet and adequate physical activity for a healthier body. It sure is a means to the end, but it isn’t the end itself.",
      "The path to healthy, sustainable weight loss is complicated, tricky, and exhausting. But Wegovy injection can help. All you need to do is begin.",
      "What should I do if my Wegovy injection pen isn’t working correctly?",
      "If your Wegovy injection pen isn’t working correctly, please contact your doctor immediately. You can also contact the manufacturer Novo Nordisk by visiting Wegovy.com.",
      "Why are there different coloured Wegovy injection pens?",
      "Wegovy injection pens come in five different doses: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg. The pen has five different colours to denote the five different dosages.",
      "Can I change the day or time to take Wegovy injection?",
      "It is recommended that you take the Wegovy injection on the same day and at the same time every week. However, if you would like to change the day and time when you take the Wegovy injection, you can do so two or more days after taking your last Wegovy dose.",
      "Do I have to take Wegovy on an empty stomach?",
      "You can take the Wegovy injection on an empty stomach or after your meal. Both methods are fine. It all depends on your convenience.",
      "I am nervous at the thought of injecting myself with Wegovy injection. What should I do?",
      "It is quite common to feel nervous before taking your Wegovy injection. To calm down, you can watch this video on taking a Wegovy injection or read these simple instructions before you begin.",
      "There is also a programme called ‘WeGo Together’ for Wegovy users. You can join the programme, where a coach will help you navigate the process of taking Wegovy.",
      "Can I travel with Wegovy?",
      "Yes, you can travel with your Wegovy injection pen. However, keep the following things in mind:",
      "How soon will I lose weight with Wegovy?",
      "Every individual is unique. And so is every individual’s weight loss journey. The time it takes for Wegovy to work differs from person to person. To get an accurate response to this question, it is best to contact your doctor, who will be able to guide you through this query.",
      "Is Ozempic a substitute for Wegovy?",
      "Although Wegovy and Ozempic both contain semaglutide, they are different products with different uses and dosages as approved by the FDA. Each medication is safe and effective in its own way. As a result, they are not interchangeable.",
      "Is there a generic version of Wegovy?",
      "Currently, there is no generic version of Wegovy available in the global market. This is because the manufacturer of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, has patented the medicine until 2026. As a result, other pharmaceutical companies cannot produce or sell generic versions of Wegovy until that time.",
      "If a generic version is available in the grey market, is it okay to use it instead of the actual Wegovy injection?",
      "Novo Nordisk, as the manufacturer of Wegovy, cannot validate the safety and efficacy of any generic version of the injection available in the grey market. As such, it is not advisable to risk your health by using generic or counterfeit medicines for weight loss.",
      "If you wish to begin your weight loss journey with a legal, safe, effective medicine, go for Aktive. Take this brief 2-minute quiz to know if you are eligible for Aktive’s weight loss treatment plans.",

      "The reason why people experience side effects while on Wegovy is that the body is adjusting to new changes.",
      "GLP-1 receptors are present in the gut, brain, pancreas, heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. When these receptors are activated by Wegovy, they affect how your body digests food, controls hunger, and regulates insulin.",
      "That’s why symptoms like nausea, bloating, or tiredness are common in the beginning. They are signs that your body is shifting gears.",

      "Certain conditions or symptoms while on Wegovy may warrant you to visit your doctor as early as possible:",
      "Yes, side effects can be frustrating, but they don't last forever. The long-term goal with Wegovy or any weight loss plan is to help you feel better at a sustainable pace.",
      "And when you stay consistent and ask for help when needed, progress follows.",
      "🎉 Launched in India in June 2025 Wegovy is available in India in the form of pre-filled injection pen (FlexTouch). You can either self-inject it or take it with the help of a healthcare professional.",
      "What medications should you not take with Wegovy?",
      "A drug interaction happens when the presence of one drug affects the actions of the second drug. Wegovy, too, can interact with different medications and supplements.",
      "Some examples include painkillers (NSAIDs), certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and some blood pressure medications.",
      "Also, combining Wegovy with insulin, oral diabetes medications and other GLP-1 (or GIP) agents can cause undesirable effects. Always inform your doctor if you are taking any medications.",
      "Does Wegovy cause hair loss?",
      "Although there is no direct link between hair loss and Wegovy, some people do notice more hair fall after starting on the drug. In a clinical trial[1] involving around 1961 people over 68 weeks, around 2.5 % participants reported hair loss.",
      "That said, most participants recovered while still taking the weight loss treatment with Wegovy.",
      "What happens if you eat too much food on Wegovy?",
      "Wegovy slows down how quickly your stomach empties, so you'll feel full much sooner than usual. So eating past that new 'full point' will increase the chances of gastrointestinal side effects like:",
      "Overeating on Wegovy isn’t dangerous in most cases, but it can be really uncomfortable. If it happens, you may need to eat simple, light meals for some time and visit your doctor.",
      "Which one is safer? Wegovy or Mounjaro?",
      "Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are considered safe when used as prescribed, but they work slightly differently and may suit different people.",
      "Wegovy contains semaglutide, while Mounjaro contains tirzepatide, which targets both GLP-1 and GIP hormones.",
      "Because of this, Mounjaro may cause more gastrointestinal side effects in some users. But it may also offer greater weight loss for others.",
      "As for safety, both come with similar risks:",
      "Can Wegovy cause Ozempic face?",
      "'Ozempic face' refers to the tired or hollow look some people get after losing weight quickly. It manifests in the form of sunken cheeks, looser skin, or more visible wrinkles. It happens because of quick fat loss throughout the body, and especially from the face.",
      "Wegovy, like other GLP-1 meds, can lead to similar changes if weight loss happens too fast. Losing weight gradually while focusing on your diet and exercise can help minimise this.",
      "Can I take a break from Wegovy?",
      "It’s best not to skip doses of Wegovy on purpose. This medication works best when it’s taken consistently every week. Missing a dose can reduce appetite control and bring back side effects when you restart.",
      "If you miss a dose:",
      "If you have missed more than one dose, you should check in with your doctor. They may ask you to go back to a lower dose so you adjust easily.",
      "Can Wegovy cause heart attacks?",
      "There’s no direct evidence that Wegovy causes heart attacks in healthy users. In fact, GLP-1 medications like Wegovy have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes.",
      "However, if you already have a heart condition, your doctor will want to monitor you more closely, especially when you are adjusting to Wegovy during your initial days.",
      "Why am I still so hungry on Wegovy?",
      "Wegovy reduces appetite for most people, but not everyone feels that effect right away. If you’re still hungry:",
      "Who should not use Wegovy?",
      "Wegovy is not recommended for:",
      "Always talk to your doctor before starting Wegovy to make sure it’s a safe fit.",
      "Is it safe to take Wegovy for life?",
      "Wegovy is generally considered safe for long-term use, but ongoing studies are still tracking its effects beyond 2–3 years.",
      "However, like any medication, there are potential risks associated with prolonged use. Possible long-term side effects include pancreatitis, gallbladder disease (such as gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder), and kidney damage.",
      "If it helps you manage your weight and improve health markers like blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, your doctor may recommend staying on it long-term and even monitor your health while you are on Wegovy.",
      "What happens if you stop Wegovy?",
      "You may also see a reduction in the side effects from the medication, usually within the first week of stopping.",
      "Although stopping Wegovy is not harmful, it comes with a few changes, like:",
      "If you're thinking of pausing or quitting Wegovy, don’t do it abruptly. Discuss this with your doctor. They may suggest tapering the dose or suggest alternatives that work better for you.",
      "Can Wegovy cause depression?",
      "Although rare, Wegovy might cause or worsen depression and mood changes in some people.",
      "Recent studies [2][3] and adverse event reports have linked semaglutide to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, especially at higher doses or in those with a history of mental health issues.",
      "But in Indian trials or safety monitoring, no statistically significant psychiatric side effects have been reported.",
      "That said, this aspect needs more research. Still, regulatory agencies advise monitoring mental health during treatment, particularly if you or your family has a history of mental health issues.",
      "If you notice new or worsening mood symptoms while on Wegovy, it’s important to speak to your doctor.",

      "After having my second child, I was stuck. The weight wouldn't move, and I constantly felt exhausted and demotivated. Aktive showed me how to control my constant food cravings. Their personalized support helped me overcome plateaus. My clothes fit beautifully, I have the stamina to handle the kids and the home, and the confidence is back.",
      "Being a business owner meant 12-hour days on my feet, constant pain, and low energy. Aktive’s simple plan worked even during the busiest seasons. Now, the joint pain is gone, I'm sharper with customers, and I have the energy to manage my business and reclaim my health.",
      "Starting my first job was overwhelming; I lived on nightly takeout and sacrificed fitness. I gained weight and felt foggy in meetings. Aktive's realistic plan helped me quickly drop the 'job weight.' My focus and energy are now consistently high, leaving me confident and sharp for the office.",
      "I was constantly battling my sweet tooth and felt like every diet was a losing fight. Aktive didn't just tell me what to eat; it helped me control my cravings. My clothes fit better, and I no longer feel guilty after a meal. It's truly amazing how much a simple programme, paired with the right guidance, can change everything.",

The weight is down, my energy is up, and I no longer feel drained. It’s the best investment I’ve made in my health and career.",
      "As a diabetic, I always felt that weight loss was tricky. I struggled with cravings and following other diets. Thanks to Aktive’s plan, my sugar readings are finally in range, and I am losing weight steadily. I can climb stairs without panting and feel more energetic than before. The best part? I don’t have to starve myself.",
      "My schedule made it hard for me to devote time to weight loss. I was tired and struggling to keep up with my kids. Aktive’s personalised weight loss plan fit my routine perfectly. Within weeks, I had more energy and could finally run around with my kids. No more knee pain during walks. Weekend outings with my family feel fun again!",
      "Tried every fad diet in the book, but couldn't resist eating junk food. With Aktive, I can finally control my sweet cravings and lose weight. Friends and colleagues began noticing the change. Their compliments motivate me even more to stay fit. Will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a lasting weight loss solution.",
      "I used to think weight loss meant giving up all my favourite foods. For the first time, I don’t feel guilty about eating.

      "Gauri D.",
      "My hectic schedule made me put on weight. I tried keto diet, intermittent fasting, paleo diet, and what not! NOTHING WORKED. Ever since I started it, I am craving less junk and feeling full after a few bites. I can REALLY stop after two spoons of ice cream or two pieces of chips.",

      "Ankit L.",
      "Unhealthy eating made me gain weight. When I found it hard to lose weight, I turned to Aktive’s weight loss programmes. It really works. The only drawback? There are a few side effects, such as nausea, headache, and lack of appetite, but for me, they didnt last very long.",
      "Shweta V.",
      "This product is good, and the service is smooth too. I got doorstep delivery, and the plan is not the best one out there, but it works nicely. I stopped binge eating within 2-3 days of starting it, and did not face any significant side effects too. Its not perfect, but so far, its been tolerable. A friend of mine tried it and got dry mouth and nausea. I guess results differ from person to person?",
      "Jyoti R.",
      "Six months before my wedding, I weighed 95 kgs. I joined the programme to lose weight before the D-Day. But I did not see much difference. Simply lost 5.5 kgs in 4 months. For me, this is a good start, but I expected more out of it.",

      "Experience hassle-free, on-time monthly deliveries of your treatment right to your doorstep.",
      "Why is your treatment more effective than other weight loss methods?",
      "Our treatment works on many levels. The active ingredient works by making your body produce more of a specific hormone that affects how hungry you feel.",
      "Increasing these hormone levels slows down digestion and stomach emptying. It affects your appetite because your brain gets the signal \"I'm full' much quicker. Which means you eat less.",
      "The medication also resets your metabolism. You have a set point that your body defends to maintain. It gives you hunger signals if you drop below this point. The hormones reset this point to a lower level.",
      "This makes it easier to stick to new eating habits.",
      "What should I go for - weight loss injection or tablet?",
      "At Aktive, we offer both weight loss injections and tablets.",
      "While both forms of weight loss medicines are effective in the long run, what will really work for you depends on your weight loss goals, which form you are most comfortable with, and the efficacy of the medicine.",
      "In the end, it is up to you to decide which form of medicine works best for you. Aktive is here to help you lose weight, no matter what you choose.",
      "I've heard of the Hollywood 'skinny jab' - is this the same?",
      "Yes. The popular term 'skinny jab' refers to treatments. However, while it sounds like it will make you 'skinny', that is not necessarily correct.",
      "It is a prescription medication designed to aid weight loss for health reasons.",
      "Like any prescription medication, our partner doctors will still need to consider your medical history before prescribing it.",
      "How much weight can I lose on your plan?",
      "Clinical trials have demonstrated that our weight loss injection is quite effective. Adults lost an average of 21% of their body weight after 16 months.",
      "However, weight loss is not a linear journey. How much weight you’ll lose on our plan depends on various individual factors such as your starting weight, medical history, regular diet, and exercise schedule.",
      "When do I qualify for your plan?",
      "Our weight loss plan is available on prescription for people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or above.",
      "Some other health issues can prevent our partner doctors from prescribing these medications to you. You can find out if it's safe by taking our quiz. It’s free.",
      "What is BMI?",
      "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of calculating your ideal body weight based on your height. When you take our quiz, it will calculate your BMI so you can know if you’re eligible. There are also online tools to calculate your BMI.",
      "Why am I struggling to lose weight?",
      "For some people, eating less and exercising more is not enough. Studies show that your genes can significantly affect how you carry weight. For some people, genetic influence can be as high as 80%.",
      "If you’re not seeing progress, you may want to reevaluate your strategy - and our treatment might be the answer. By feeling full more quickly and for longer, it’s easier to reduce your calorie intake and lose weight successfully.",
      "Do I need to go on a diet?",
      "Following a healthy lifestyle is the best way to get the best results from weight loss treatment. You should reduce the number of calories you consume and eat a healthy, balanced diet.",
      "Our personalised meal plan helps you to avoid eating very fatty and sugary foods, as they are high in calories and lacking in nutrients.",
      "Our fitness plan helps with light exercise, 3 times a week. Both factors will help you get the most out of your weight loss treatment and speed up results.",
      "Why do I need to do the medical consultation?",
      "Our partner doctors review your answers to determine if our weight loss plan is safe for you. As we provide prescription medications, it’s important you answer all questions honestly.",
      "Do I know immediately if I qualify for treatment?",
      "Once you’ve placed your order, our partner doctors review your medical history. If they have additional questions, we'll contact you via email. We will not take payment unless you qualify and we can send you the treatment.",
      "What's included in the weight loss subscription plan?",
      "Our subscription includes a delivery service every 4 weeks, with each package containing 4 weeks of treatment. Our partner doctors will check your health every month and monitor your progress. Our plans also include support from a nutritionist and health coach. This way, we can give you the support you need. Our plans are all-inclusive: treatment, free delivery, personalised meal plan, fitness plan and support from our weight loss specialists.",
      "Will you monitor my health and progress?",
      "Yes, our partner doctors will ask you to update your health information before each delivery. This way, they can monitor how you are doing and give you additional advice if needed.",

      "Just remember, no headstands or anything like shoulder stands (Sarvangasana) should be done during this time.",

      "Zero-calorie foods. Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?",
      "But here’s the thing…except for plain water, no food is truly calorie-free.",
      "But that doesn't mean you cannot find healthy, low-calorie foods in your kitchen.",
      "If you're trying to eat lighter without feeling starved, these low-calorie foods deserve a permanent place on your plate.",
      "Read this list to discover everyday foods that are low in calories and are readily available at your local vegetable market. Nothing fancy, nothing gourmet, nothing pricey. It’s affordable and accessible.",
      "So, are you ready to discover a more innovative way to stay healthy?",
      "First things first: no fruit, vegetable, or dish is truly \"zero calorie.\" The only real zero-calorie ingredient is plain water.",
      "So, what are low-calorie foods?",
      "There isn't a fixed definition, but here’s a general idea.",
      "Low-calorie foods, as the name suggests, are foods that contain very few calories per serving. They can add volume, fibre, or water to your meal.",
      "If images of a cucumber or a watermelon are floating in your mind, you are on the right track.",
      "You can eat these foods in larger quantities and still fulfil your daily calorie goals.",
      "However, keep in mind that these foods do not help you burn fat on their own. They only support weight loss when consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet.",
      "Basically, low-calorie foods make you feel full and don’t add up much to your daily calorie intake, so you eat well and don’t crave more food.",
      "We have all grown up with the idea that when we eat less, we lose more weight.",
      "However, the truth is that when we starve ourselves, we end up feeling hungrier, more tired, and more prone to cravings. And that isn't sustainable.",
      "Here's why eating low-calorie foods is a wise choice:",
      "Without much ado, let’s see which low-calorie foods we need to add to our diet.",
      "1. Cucumber (Kheera)",
      "Calories: Approx. 10 calories per 100g",
      "Crisp, cooling, and made up of over 95% water, kheera is a classic Indian summer staple. It also contains small amounts of potassium and vitamin K, which makes it a great option for hydration and mild electrolyte support.",
      "Did you know?",
      "Cucumber has been cultivated for over 3,000 years. It was even used in ancient Indian and Egyptian cultures as a cooling remedy!",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "2. Spinach (Palak)",
      "Calories: Approx. 22-28 calories per 100g",
      "The bright green foliage of palak is a powerhouse of iron, folate, and vitamin A.",
      "Popeye’s favourite food adds bulk, fibre, and colour to your plate, nourishing you well.",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "3. Zucchini (Courgette)",
      "Calories: Approx. 16-19 calories per 100g.",
      "Light, juicy, and mild in taste, zucchini is a vegetable that is steadily growing in popularity across India. It is rich in antioxidants (like lutein and zeaxanthin), folate, potassium, vitamin C, and fibre. It has nearly 95% water, and almost no fat!",
      "The best part is that zucchini can easily be incorporated into Indian dishes, making it perfect for days when you want to eat more volume but stay within your calorie limit.",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "4. Mushrooms (Khumb/Khumbi/Kukurmutta)",
      "Calories: Approx. 25-31 calories per 100g",
      "Earthy, chewy, and surprisingly filling, mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, selenium, and antioxidants.",
      "Interestingly, when exposed to sunlight, they’re also one of the rare vegetarian sources of vitamin D!",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "Most of the vegetables mentioned above pair well with grilled or raw paneer. With just the right amount of protein and calories in 100g paneer, this white delight can cover a huge portion of your daily protein needs.",
      "5. Watermelon (Tarbuj)",
      "Calories: Approx. 30 calories per 100g",
      "If there’s something that makes water blush red, it’s watermelon. It is over 90% water, naturally sweet, and just what your body craves on a hot day.",
      "It’s also a source of vitamin C and lycopene (a powerful antioxidant).",
      "Watermelon is technically both a fruit and a vegetable, since it belongs to the cucumber family.",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "6. Strawberries (Jharber/Hisalu)",
      "Calories: Approx. 33-36 calories per 100g",
      "Juicy, tangy-sweet, and rich in antioxidants, strawberries are a great source of vitamin C and manganese. Each berry holds almost 200 seeds on the outside!",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "7. Unsweetened lemon water (Nimbu pani)",
      "Calories: Approx. 15 calories per 100g lemon",
      "Lemon water is that easy, everyday habit that reduces your cravings, improves digestion, and adds vitamin C with every sip.",
      "In ancient Rome, lemons were so prized that they were considered a symbol of luxury!",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "Short on time and looking for a light yet filling breakfast? A veggie-loaded poha with peanuts and a squeeze of lemon is the perfect low-calorie breakfast.",
      "Read: Here's how you can enjoy poha smartly for weight loss.",
      "8. Unsweetened green tea",
      "Calories: Approx. 3 calories per cup (236.5ml)",
      "Green tea has become a ritual for many during tea breaks. This is thanks to its light taste and antioxidant content. It is rich in catechins, which work as a metabolism booster.",
      "Bonus? You can steep the same leaves 2–3 times and enjoy your tea multiple times.",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "Try these 7 best Indian homemade drinks for weight loss to stay refreshed and energised without overloading on calories.",
      "9. Bell peppers (Shimla mirch)",
      "Calories: Approx. 17 calories per 100g",
      "Crunchy and colourful, bell peppers are a good choice if you are looking to add volume without the calories.",
      "Red and yellow peppers have the most antioxidants, while green ones offer a slightly earthy, traditional flavour.",
      "Bell peppers are a good source of fibre, vitamins A & C, and have a low glycaemic index. This makes them ideal for keeping you full and managing cravings.",
      "They are easy to cook and make Indian, Asian or continental dishes yummier.",
      "How to add it to your diet:",
      "A spicy bonus",
      "Who said spices can’t have fun? Eating healthy does not mean your food should taste bland. So let’s open that masala-dani and elevate the taste.",
      "P.S. These spices are also sure to support your weight loss efforts.",
      "You’ve got your hand on a low-calorie food. But the trick lies in eating them smartly. Here’s what you can do to consume your low-calorie foods more effectively.",
      "Weight loss doesn't mean starving yourself. When you focus on the right foods in the right combinations, your meals can be both delicious and healthy.",
      "Traditional low-calorie foods can absolutely support your weight loss plans. You simply need to know how to use them wisely.",
      "Eating a healthy diet is one aspect of weight loss. But a structured approach that prioritises your food habits, movement, and recovery can make all the difference.",
      "If you are looking for a weight loss plan that actually works for you, try Aktive.",
      "How many calories should I eat daily?",
      "Your daily calorie intake depends on several factors, including age, weight, activity level, and your specific fitness goals.",
      "Typically, it is recommended that women consume between 1,200 -1,600 calories per day, while men may need 1,500 -1,800 calories.",
      "However, instead of worrying about numbers, you can manage your calorie intake by creating balanced meals and monitoring your portions.",
      "Adding more foods that are high in water and fibre can reduce your hunger and keep you full for longer.",
      "Can I eat more if I eat low-calorie foods?",
      "Yes. That’s the beauty of it.",
      "Low-calorie, high-volume foods like lauki, cucumber, spinach, and clear soups allow you to eat more food and feel full, all while staying within your calorie target.",
      "However, a diet consisting exclusively of low-calorie foods may not keep you full or provide sufficient nutrition.",
      "For this reason, you will need to balance your meals with a combination of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats.",
      "Can I eat these low-calorie foods every day?",
      "Yes, you can.",
      "Vegetables like kheera, spinach, lauki, and mushrooms are meant for daily eating. They are light, hydrating, and full of fibre and micronutrients.",
      "Just keep variety in your meals and pair these vegetables with protein (such as dal, paneer, or curd) and healthy carbs like multigrain roti or brown rice. That is enough for balanced nutrition.",
      "Are low-calorie foods enough for nutrition, or do I need supplements?",
      "Low-calorie foods are great, but they are not enough on their own.",
      "Vegetables and fruits can give you fibre and micronutrients, but they are low in protein and healthy fats. These are two things your body needs every day.",
      "Every meal should include:",
      "If you eat a varied Indian diet that covers all food groups, supplements are usually not needed unless you have a specific deficiency.",
      "However, if you are severely restricting calories or avoiding entire food groups, consult your doctor to determine if you may need vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, or calcium supplements.",
      "What are empty-calorie foods?",
      "These are foods that provide calories but are low in nutrients. Some examples are:",
      "They often sneak into the diet through chai-time cravings or during celebrations/festivities. To cut down their intake, you can replace them with whole foods or roasted snacks.",
      "What are negative-calorie foods?",
      "Negative-calorie foods are a myth.",
      "Even low-calorie foods like lauki, tomatoes, palak, or mushrooms do not make your body burn more calories than they contain. The thermic effect of food is too small for that.",
      "For a food to become “negative,” your body would need to burn more than 100 percent of its calories during digestion, which is impossible. Therefore, the concept lacks scientific backing.",
      "What is volume eating?",
      "Volume eating means consuming more foods that have a high bulk (due to fibre or water), but very few calories.",
      "This includes raw veggies, leafy greens, clear soups, and fruits with high water content. It helps you eat more, feel full, and still stay within your calorie limit.",
      "How do I make a complete Indian meal under 300 calories?",
      "You can try these meal combinations:",
      "Can I drink lemon water multiple times a day for faster weight loss?",
      "You can have plain lemon water 2–3 times a day if it suits your digestion.",
      "Although it doesn’t directly melt fat, it reduces bloating and helps control your appetite. It also keeps you hydrated.",
      "Lemon water is a good replacement for sugary chai or juices. But overdoing it can be harmful to your digestion and teeth.",
      "Why am I not losing weight even with low-calorie foods?",
      "Eating low-calorie foods is a key aspect of weight loss.",
      "However, a variety of factors also have an impact on weight loss, such as:",
      "In fact, starving yourself or not consuming enough protein can trigger your body into survival mode, making it even more challenging to lose weight.",
      "Is your diet low-calorie but not protein-rich? Explore our 7-day protein-rich diet plan for weight loss, pair it with low-calorie foods, and watch the magic happen.",
      "If the scale isn’t moving despite your efforts, consider consulting a dietitian to identify any nutritional gaps or underlying issues.",
      "Do I need to count calories if I eat these low-calorie foods?",
      "Not really, but a little awareness can be helpful.",
      "Low-calorie, high-volume foods naturally stop you from overeating because they fill you up quickly. If half your plate is vegetables like kheera, palak, or lauki, you are already on the right path.",
      "What you still need to watch out for are the calorie-dense foods.",
      "Excessive oil consumption while cooking or overeating dry fruits or paneer, because they are considered \"healthy\", can add up faster than you think.",
      "So start with portion control and good food choices instead of counting every calorie.",
      "If your weight loss slows down, tracking your food intake for a week or two can help identify hidden calories.",
      "Should I avoid rice altogether if I want to lose weight?",
      "Not at all.",
      "It’s about quantity and what you eat with it. Instead of a full plate, try half a katori of rice with sabzi, dal, and salad.",
      "Swap regular white rice with brown rice, red rice, poha, daliya, or millet varieties for more fibre.",
