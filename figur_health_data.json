        "Dr. Yoshiro Hatano's work[1] inspired a company to develop an early form of a pedometer in the 1960s. Concerned with the way the Japanese were adopting a sedentary lifestyle, Dr Hatano devised an interesting strategy. If only he could convince fellow Japanese citizens to walk 10,000 steps daily. His countrymen would burn a staggering 500 calories in a single day.",
        "The result? They would get slim and stay slim. This idea sparked the '10,000 steps a day' program, which turned out to be a marketing hit.",
        "The company named the step-tracking device 'manpo-kei,' which means '10,000 steps measure'. Over time, this target gained global popularity as a benchmark for physical activity. Many health organisations and fitness enthusiasts endorsed it.",

        "This equals burning almost 2,100 to 3,100 calories per week through walking alone.",
        "In 2004, researchers Catrine Tudor-Locke and David R. Bassett Jr introduced graduated step index for healthy adults.[2]",
        "According to their research, they developed an index of physical activity levels according to daily steps. They categorised individuals into sedentary, low activity, somewhat active, active, and highly active groups.",
        "However, preliminary evidence[2] suggests that a goal of 10,000 steps a day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases (more on this in a minute).",
        "Another concern about using 10,000 steps/day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population who struggle with obesity.",
        "So, the researchers came up with revised step targets for different individuals, which came to this:",
        "Walking 10,000 steps a day isn't just a marketing strategy. Several studies support that people who walked 10,000 steps a day at medium to fast pace and ate a healthy diet saw great results. They lost weight, felt better overall, reduced their waist size, and experienced improvements in physical fitness and mental health.",
        "The 10,000 steps per day are an ideal target. However, studies show that even 7,500 steps a day can reduce the risk of chronic diseases to a great extent. The key is to stay consistently active.",
        "For example, a study[3] by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reported a breakthrough finding. Women taking at least 4,400 steps daily had a significantly lower mortality rate over a four-year period compared to those taking fewer steps.",

High impact on joints can lead to further damage and discomfort. Consult your doctor before deciding to walk 10,000 steps every day.",
        "Surgeries can tire the body. Recovering from a recent surgery? Avoid strenuous activities until you heal completely. This helps ensure a smooth recovery.",
        "Walking long distances can strain the heart and muscles. If you have chronic health and heart conditions, start slowly. You can gradually increase the steps as and when your doctor advises.",

        "Add Formal Exercise: To reach your goal, add a 20-30-minute walk in the morning or evening. This can be outdoors or on a treadmill.",

Understanding the origin and popularity Dr. Yoshiro Hatano's work [1] inspired a company to develop an early form of a pedometer in the 1960s. Concerned with the way the Japanese were adopting a sedentary lifestyle, Dr Hatano devised an interesting strategy. If only he could convince fellow Japanese citizens to walk 10,000 steps daily. His countrymen would burn a staggering 500 calories in a single day. The result? They would get slim and stay slim. This idea sparked the '10,000 steps a day' program, which turned out to be a marketing hit. The company named the step-tracking device ' manpo-kei ,' which means ' 10,000 steps measure '. Over time, this target gained global popularity as a benchmark for physical activity. Many health organisations and fitness enthusiasts endorsed it. 10,000 steps also equal to: Up to 8 km of walking (for most people). One hour and 40 minutes of your day. Brisk walking in a 30-60-minute time frame. This equals burning almost 2,100 to 3,100 calories per week through walking alone. In 2004, researchers Catrine Tudor-Locke and David R. Bassett Jr introduced graduated step index for healthy adults. [2] According to their research, they developed an index of physical activity levels according to daily steps. They categorised individuals into sedentary, low activity, somewhat active, active, and highly active groups. Activity Level Steps per Day Range Sedentary < 5,000 steps Low Activity 5,000 – 7,499 steps Somewhat Active 7,500 – 9,999 steps Active > 10,000 steps Highly Active > 12,500 steps However, preliminary evidence [2] suggests that a goal of 10,000 steps a day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases (more on this in a minute). Another concern about using 10,000 steps/day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population who struggle with obesity. So, the researchers came up with revised step targets for different individuals, which came to this: Age Daily Steps Preschool children (4-6 years) At least 8,000 steps/day Girls (6-11 years) At least 10,000 steps/day Boys (6-11 years) At least 13,000 steps/day Adolescents (12-19 years) At least 10,000 steps/day Adults (20-65 years) At least 7,000 steps/day Individuals with disabilities or chronic illness As per doctor's advice, but aim for as many steps as possible Extra physical activity Additional daily steps For moderate physical activity At least 15,000 steps/week, e.g., 3,000 daily steps most days of the week For vigorous physical activity At least 6,000 daily steps The science behind walking 10,000 steps a day Walking 10,000 steps a day isn't just a marketing strategy. Several studies support that people who walked 10,000 steps a day at medium to fast pace and ate a healthy diet saw great results. They lost weight, felt better overall, reduced their waist size, and experienced improvements in physical fitness and mental health. The 10,000 steps per day are an ideal target. However, studies show that even 7,500 steps a day can reduce the risk of chronic diseases to a great extent. The key is to stay consistently active. For example, a study [3] by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reported a breakthrough finding. Women taking at least 4,400 steps daily had a significantly lower mortality rate over a four-year period compared to those taking fewer steps. However, aiming higher is even better. So, 10,000 steps a day can make you feel more positive about your body and motivate you to perform more physical activity. But it doesn't end there. Walking offers a wide range of benefits apart from motivation. Below a non-exhaustive list: 6 benefits of walking 10,000 steps a day A team of scientists at Edinburgh University conducted a study to understand how walking impacts the human body. Here’s what they found: 1. Overall fitness Weight Loss: A gentle walk helps you lose weight, improves your BMI, and reduce waist size. In the end, you will feel leaner and more confident. Enhanced Energy Levels: Regular walking boosts energy levels. Increased Life Expectancy: Walking impacts longevity and quality of life. Better Sleep: Walking regulates your circadian rhythms (sleep cycle) and reduces stress to improve sleep quality. Blood Sugar Control: Walking makes your muscles use more glucose, lowering blood sugar. Cancer and Disease Prevention: Walking lowers various health risks. Especially for breast and colon cancers, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and heart failure. 2. Improved cardiac system Pumping Strong: Walking enhances your heart's ability to pump efficiently and improves blood vessel control (vascular resistance). Blood Pressure: Walking can reduce blood pressure by 2mmHg to 4mmHg. This lowers the risk of cardiac disease and makes the heart healthy. 3. Better nervous system Improved Cognitive Function: Regular walking boosts your thinking ability and focus. Walking also lowers the risk of dementia. 4. Stronger musculoskeletal system Muscle Strength and Endurance: Walking makes the muscles strong and keeps you active and independent for a long, long time. Bone Health: Walking prevents bone mineral loss, especially in older adults and post-menopausal women. This reduces the risk of osteoporosis (a bone-related health issue). Joint Flexibility: Walking naturally lubricates the joints. This helps reduce stiffness, relieve arthritis pain, and helps move around comfortably. 5. Fine tuned immune system Better Immunity: Regular walking improves the immune system and reduces the risk of inflammation. This means less sick time. 6. Balanced mental and emotional health Mental Wellbeing: Walking releases endorphins, reducing stress and improving the mood. Who should be cautious about walking 10,000 steps a day? While walking benefits most people, it’s best to proceed with caution in some instances: Patients with severe arthritis While walking is a low-impact exercise, and taking small, slow steps is beneficial for arthritis pain management, excessive walking might worsen joint pain if you have severe arthritis. High impact on joints can lead to further damage and discomfort. Consult your doctor before deciding to walk 10,000 steps every day. Patients who had recent surgeries Surgeries can tire the body. Recovering from a recent surgery? Avoid strenuous activities until you heal completely. This helps ensure a smooth recovery. Patients with chronic pain & severe heart health conditions Walking long distances can strain the heart and muscles. If you have chronic health and heart conditions, start slowly. You can gradually increase the steps as and when your doctor advises. Recommendations Even when doing something as simple as walking, always listen to your body . Understand your body's tolerance levels. Seek medical advice if you have underlying health issues. A healthcare professional can help you start safely. Is walking something you cannot do right now? Why not try alternate options like swimming or cycling? These activities will help you stay fit without complicating your health. It is like having your cake and eating it too! How to reach the 10,000 steps a day goal? We know, walking 10,000 steps a day might feel like such a task. But, when you do it the right way, you are sure to enjoy every bit. 1. Start small Yes, the 10,000-step a day goal is a popular benchmark. But it is important to consider individual starting points. Many office workers average 3,000 to 5,000 steps daily , while sedentary individuals may only manage 1,000. Remember, this isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. Begin with achievable goals and gradually increase your step count. Starting small will save you from burnout and reduce the risk of injury. 2. Pick the right footwear Your walking shoes can make or break your fitness regimen. Ideally, these shoes should be comfortable, with enough space for your toes to move freely. They should provide the right level of arch support and good cushioning to absorb shock. Shoes with a firm midsole, a supportive heel counter, and a durable rubber outsole can offer adequate stability and traction. Mesh uppers or perforated panels will keep your feet comfortable and dry by allowing airflow. Additionally, they should offer good motion and flexibility to support natural foot movement. Does this information sound too complex? Watch the video below to simplify your process of choosing the right shoes for walking. How to choose the best shoes for a walking workout? 3. Be a part of a walking group Join local walking groups or start one with friends and family. You can even look for walking groups on social media. You will find many options on platforms like Meetup and Facebook. In Mumbai and Pune, there is a once-in-a-month program - 'Walk With A Doc' , where people walk around lush green areas of the city with a doctor. You can enrol as well and find motivation to get started. How to incorporate walking into daily routine While focusing on specific targets like walking 10,000 steps is natural, goals can change or shift over time. On the other hand, systems help you continue your progress instead of simply achieving it. Basically, this means that the journey is more important than the destination itself. Here are some quick tips you can try to set up a walking routine for yourself: Get a Pedometer: Invest in an accurate pedometer or fitness tracker. Apps like Google Fit and Apple Health can help you monitor your activity levels and provide motivation. Try walking for at least 30 minutes every day or squeeze in short, frequent walks if you don’t have a pedometer. Track Your Baseline: For the first week, track your normal daily steps without changing your routine. Calculate your average daily steps by adding the total steps for the week and dividing by seven. Set Gradual Goals: Gradually increase your daily steps by 10-20% each week. For example, if your baseline is 5,000 steps, aim for 5,500 to 6,000 steps the next week. Speed: For weight loss, experts recommend a quicker pace of 5.6 to 7.2 kilometres per hour for at least 30 minutes. Serious enthusiasts can aim for speeds of 6.4 to 8 kilometres per hour or faster. Add Steps Throughout Your Day: Opt for the stairs over elevators. Get off the bus or train one stop early. Walk to the nearby market instead of driving. Add Formal Exercise: To reach your goal, add a 20-30-minute walk in the morning or evening. This can be outdoors or on a treadmill. Monitor and Adjust: Continue to track your steps and adjust your goals. You may reach 10,000 steps in three weeks. Or maybe, you need to continue increasing your steps by 10-20% each week until you build the habit. No matter what, keep going. Stay Consistent: Track your steps daily and make small, manageable changes to your routine to increase your activity level. 4 tips to maximise the benefits of walking 10,000 steps Here are some things you can do to maximise the benefits of walking 10,000 steps every day. 1. Walk in all weathers Don’t let the weather spoil your walking plans. In summer, walk early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the heat. During monsoon, walk around indoor spaces like malls, the clubhouse, or your home. You can also invest in a treadmill or follow a YouTube walking workout at home. In winter, dress in layers and warm up well before walking to prevent muscle stiffness. Not sure how to start an indoor walk workout? Check out this YouTube video to take the first step towards fitness: How to do a 10-minute walking workout at home: 2. Walk safely Always try to walk on designated footpaths and cross streets safely. Observe your surroundings and avoid walking in isolated areas, especially after dark. Many cities have common gardens and parks where you can enjoy walking without worrying about safety. Are you planning a hike/trek to cover your 10,000 steps a day regimen? Don't forget to follow the checklist of essential items you must bring to the hike. Wear reflective clothing if you are walking in low-light conditions. Carry a small flashlight or use a headlamp if you are walking at night. 3. Follow A healthy diet Fitness is 80% diet and 20% exercise. Boost your walking routine with a balanced diet of whole grains, lentils, vegetables, and fruits. Say no to processed foods and sugary snacks. You can enjoy the traditional and nutritious dal , roti , sabzi , and buttermilk. Add turmeric, ginger, and other herbs to your meals, as they have anti-inflammatory properties. Switch to lemon and honey drinks to reduce your calorie intake from sugary beverages. Here are some healthy and delicious recipes for Indian meals that will keep you fit and fine: Indian Recipes for Weight Loss by Kabita’s Kitchen Healthy Recipes by Tarla Dalal Healthy Recipes by Your Food Lab 4. Combine your walks with yoga Walking and yoga are powerful tools for improving health, and they work even better together. BMJ, in a recent report [4] , revealed that combining yoga with walking helped clinically depressed people (along with medications). Start your routine with a brisk 10-minute walk to get your heart pumping and warm your muscles. After your walk, try yoga poses like sun salutations, warrior poses, and downward-facing dog pose. Remember to focus on mindful breathing. You can also add these yoga poses to enhance your walking form.

Let’s address some common barriers to walking with practical tips on how to overcome them: 1. Time constraints Contrary to popular belief, not everyone has the same kind of 24 hours. You can only make time for walking if you prioritise it. Pro Tip: Take time out for walking by squeezing quick, fun walks in your daily chores. Even 10-15 minute walks after breakfast, lunch, and dinner or anytime throughout the day will make a difference. Consider walking while on virtual meetings or phone calls. 2. Battling boredom Monotony is among the biggest barriers to any activity. A change in routine is what keeps things interesting. Pro Tip: Change your walking routine once in a while by exploring new neighbourhoods, parks, or trails. Walk with a friend to avoid boredom. Enjoy music or podcasts while on a walk, or join a walking group for motivation. 3. Physical limitations If you have health conditions, start slow. Listen to your body and consult a doctor if needed. Pro Tip: Start with short, manageable walks and gradually increase speed and step count. Invest in supportive walking shoes. Always stretch and warm up before walking. 4. Limited visibility and poor lighting If your schedule allows only nighttime walks, lack of proper lighting can interfere with visibility and increase the risk of stepping into a ditch or slipping on a puddle (or a fruit peel). Pro Tip: Wear reflective clothing and carry a flashlight or headlamp to remain visible in darker areas. If possible, choose well-lit areas, and plan walks during daylight when possible. 5. Difficulty finding suitable walking paths We are in India. We know how tough it is to find smooth, clear roads to walk on. But, it is not impossible. Pro Tip: Research local parks, nature reserves, or community centres with walking trails. Explore footpaths or pedestrian-friendly areas. Check with local centres or walking clubs for recommendations on safe, accessible routes. Community programs for walkers Unlike expensive gym memberships, walking is an easy and doable exercise that benefits everyone. All you need is a good pair of shoes and comfortable clothes. Community support in exercise is powerful. A Discovery Channel documentary recorded Indian paratroopers training for the 100 km run. It showed that those who ran solo tired quickly, while those who stayed with their teams completed the run successfully. Even with a slow pace. Walking with a group can provide motivation and accountability. So, the activity feels less like a chore and more like a social event. Local initiatives A healthy nation is the result of its healthy people. The ' Fit India Movement ' is one such progressive initiative by the Hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to promote a physically active lifestyle. The movement also promotes participation in walkathons and cyclothons. Moreover, it motivates people to use facilities made for sports at schools and community centres. Walk, cycle, do yoga – anything for an hour a day. Additionally, cities like Hyderabad and Dehradun are creating pedestrian-friendly zones to make walking safer and more enjoyable. Conclusion Walking every day offers a host of benefits. Combined with a healthy diet, it can lead to weight loss, improved heart health, better muscle endurance, and enhanced immunity. To get the most out of this activity, it's important to stay consistent and committed. Whether it's 10,000 steps or any number that suits you, add intention to your walks by moving at a slightly faster pace than usual. Find joy in being active without worrying about specific targets. Preparing the right way for any task is a battle half won. Use a fitness tracker or pedometer, or simply commit to a 30-minute walk. Find a walking buddy, make it fun with music, or join a community. Focus on how great you’ll feel after a walk—both physically and mentally. Reward yourself for hitting your walking goals with something you enjoy (just skip the binge-eating!). You will not find a simpler, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly way to stay active and boost your mental health. Start now. FAQs Is it okay to take breaks while walking 10,000 steps?

With 286-331 calories and upto 25g protein in a 100g serving of paneer , you can count on this dairy product. In this article, we'll talk about what makes paneer so healthy, its benefits, and the best ways to eat it for weight loss. We’ll also see how it compares to other protein sources like eggs and tofu. By the end, you’ll know exactly how to enjoy paneer without derailing your weight loss goals. What is paneer? Paneer is a fresh, unaged cheese that is made by curdling almost boiled milk with lemon juice, lactic acid, or vinegar. The curds produced are then strained and pressed firmly to form a block. When done right, curdling ensures the resulting cheese is soft and has a non-bitter taste. It is a rich source of protein, and unlike other cheeses, paneer doesn't melt. This way, it maintains its shape and can be easily grilled, fried, or added to gravy-based dishes. No wonder some people say, “ Paneer toh beta itni itni thailiyon me sunar ki dukan pe bikega…” If we compare homemade paneer with store-bought version, homemade paneer is fresher, softer, and certainly free from preservatives and additives . You can also make low-fat paneer at home from skimmed milk. This reduces your intake of saturated fat. However, its high moisture content makes it more likely to be spoiled by microorganisms. When stored at 4°C or below, paneer can retain its freshness for about three days. Refrigerating it at around -18°C can extend its shelf life for upto four months! Nutritional value of paneer A 100g serving of paneer includes several nutrients. Read the food label below to know more about the paneer ’s nutritional value. Note: The nutritional value of paneer largely depends on the kind of milk used. Sheep milk paneer is rich in fat but slightly low in protein compared to buffalo and cow milk paneer . Goat milk paneer has low fat compared to sheep milk paneer . However, it also lacks protein compared to buffalo and cow milk paneer . Buffalo milk paneer is loved by many for its richness and creamy texture. But this means, that paneer made from buffalo milk has high fat and high protein. Cow milk paneer is soft, low in fat, and high in protein, which makes it a good option for people watching their waistline. If you eat paneer made from buffalo milk, it will have more fat, protein, and a higher cholesterol content. Paneer made from cow’s milk has relatively less cholesterol. So, if you enjoy eating paneer , prefer eating the one made from cow’s milk. - Dr. Bimal Chhajer , Cardiologist, SAAOL Now that we know paneer is a nutrient-dense food, we need to be careful about the portions we eat. This makes it easier to maximise the benefits of protein without consuming excess fat.

        "Yes, why not? The following modifications will be helpful:",
        "Can we do surya namaskar in the evening?",
        "Practising surya namaskar in the morning (at sunrise) is a great way to relieve your body of stiffness and refresh the mind.",
        "However, it doesn't mean you cannot do it at evening. Doing it at evening[2] or at night will help you destress better. The important thing is that there must be a gap of 2-3 hours between your last meal and exercise.",
        "I am a beginner. Can I do surya namaskar?",
        "Yes, why not? At the beginner stage, it is recommended that you start slow, focus on keeping your postures correct and aligning the breathing patterns accordingly.",
        "What should I do if I feel dizzy while practising?",
        "If at any point you feel dizzy while performing the surya namaskar, the first thing to do is STOP. Then, rest in a seated position and seek medical care immediately if the symptoms persist.",
        "How many rounds of surya namaskar should I perform daily for weight loss?",
        "You can start with a few warm-up exercises followed by 5-6 rounds of surya namaskar in the beginning. As you build stamina, strength, and flexibility, gradually increase the count to 12 rounds.",
        "This will give the best results if you maintain a healthy diet and a calorie deficit as well.",
        "Is it necessary to chant mantras during surya namaskar?",
        "Although reciting them isn’t mandatory, chanting the beej mantras associated with the individual poses can enhance the practice by deepening the spiritual connection and creating a more meditative experience.",
        "Here are the beej mantras that are associated with the different poses of surya namaskar:",
        "Can children practice surya namaskar?",
        "Yes. Children can practice surya namaskar under adult supervision to ensure they do so with the right technique and posture.",
        "In fact, children are gifted with more flexibility than adults, which is why practising surya namaskars from early childhood can enhance their physical strength and improve their mental focus.",
        "Is it necessary to warm up before doing surya namaskar?",
        "Doing a light walk, jog, or some stretches before surya namaskar (or any other exercise) will ensure that your muscles receive adequate blood flow and your joints are ready for extra physical load.",
        "Can surya namaskar reduce belly fat?",
        "When combined with a healthy diet, positive lifestyle changes, and adequate calorie deficit, surya namaskar can be an effective way to lose belly fat. It is a full-body workout.",
        "However, only doing surya namaskar cannot help with spot reduction. This exercise does engage the abdominal muscles but actual fat loss is only possible through consistent physical activity, strength training, and a balanced diet.",
        "Can I practice surya namaskar indoors?",
        "Definitely. You only need a nice, clean space where you can move around freely.",
        "Can surya namaskar help in weight loss?",
        "As discussed above, doing surya namaskar regularly is a great way of losing body fat and maintaining a healthy BMI.",
        "You can burn almost 14 calories with every round of surya namaskar. With time, your body becomes more efficient in utilising energy, which is essential for losing weight.",
        "Can I do surya namaskar during periods?",
        "Doing surya namaskar during periods is a personal choice and depends on how you feel. If you regularly experience severe cramps, fatigue, or heavy flow during your period, it's best to rest or do very gentle movements.",
        "In such instances, avoid deep forward bends or high-intensity rounds so that you do not experience pressure on the abdomen.",
        "If you have PCOS, endometriosis, or fibroids, it's best to consult your doctor before you practise surya namaskar.",
        "Can I take a bath immediately after doing surya namaskar?",
        "It is best to wait a while before you take a bath after your surya namaskar routine. This will allow your warmed-up body to cool down gently and prevent it from being exposed to sudden shifts in temperature. Wait for 20-30 minutes post-exercise before you head to the showers.",

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Milind Usha Soman (@milindrunning) Who should be careful while doing surya namaskar? Some conditions may require you to be careful while doing surya namaskar, modify your technique or avoid doing it altogether. These include: Pregnant women (especially in the second and third trimester). Consult a prenatal expert for advice on safer alternatives. Menstruating women (as it involves forward bending and adds pressure on the abdomen). Senior citizens (vulnerable due to weaker joints, reduced muscle strength, balance issues, cardiovascular risks, and slower recovery). People with spinal conditions like slipped discs or chronic back pain. People with any physical injury. People with severe arthritis or other joint-related issues. People with uncontrolled high or low blood pressure. People with recent heart or abdominal surgery. People with hernia (where an organ or part of it pushes through a weak spot in the muscle or tissue). People with peptic ulcer (an open sore in the inner lining of the stomach or intestine). But this does not mean you have to stop exercising. With your yoga trainer’s help, you can do surya namaskar by modifying its poses or trying some alternative workouts (to know more, refer to the FAQ section below) If you're elderly or have limited mobility, take it slow—there's no rush. Start with gentle stretches or chair yoga to build flexibility and strength before you ease into the full surya namaskar sequence. 12 steps to better health With time, you'll find how elegantly the 12 poses of surya namaskar benefit your body, calm your mind (and help you lose weight, of course).

If you wish to make your fitness journey even more effective, Aktive’s weight loss plans will help you stay accountable, build healthy habits, and lose weight sustainably. Curious if you're eligible? Let's get started! FAQs How do I modify surya namaskar if I have limited flexibility? Yes, why not? The following modifications will be helpful: If you have back pain, avoid deep forward bends and try supported half-bends instead. In case of joint issues, you can modify lunges by placing a cushion under your knee for support. For the raised arms pose ( hasta uttanasana ), raise your arms only to shoulder height. For the hand-to-foot pose ( hasta padasana ) and forward bend ( uttanasana ), You can bend your knees partially rather than keeping them entirely straight. For the equestrian pose ( aswa sanchalanasana ), step one foot back and lower the back knee to reduce its impact. Can we do surya namaskar in the evening? Practising surya namaskar in the morning (at sunrise) is a great way to relieve your body of stiffness and refresh the mind. However, it doesn't mean you cannot do it at evening. Doing it at evening [2] or at night will help you destress better. The important thing is that there must be a gap of 2-3 hours between your last meal and exercise. I am a beginner. Can I do surya namaskar? Yes, why not? At the beginner stage, it is recommended that you start slow, focus on keeping your postures correct and aligning the breathing patterns accordingly. What should I do if I feel dizzy while practising? If at any point you feel dizzy while performing the surya namaskar, the first thing to do is STOP. Then, rest in a seated position and seek medical care immediately if the symptoms persist. How many rounds of surya namaskar should I perform daily for weight loss? You can start with a few warm-up exercises followed by 5-6 rounds of surya namaskar in the beginning. As you build stamina, strength, and flexibility, gradually increase the count to 12 rounds. This will give the best results if you maintain a healthy diet and a calorie deficit as well. Is it necessary to chant mantras during surya namaskar? Although reciting them isn’t mandatory, chanting the beej mantras associated with the individual poses can enhance the practice by deepening the spiritual connection and creating a more meditative experience. Here are the beej mantras that are associated with the different poses of surya namaskar: Prayer pose ( Pranamasana ) – Om Mitraya Namaha Raised arms pose ( Hastauttanasana ) – Om Ravaye Namaha Standing forward bend ( Padahastasana ) – Om Suryaya Namaha Equestrian pose ( Ashwa sanchalanasana ) – Om Bhanave Namaha Stick pose ( Dandasana ) – Om Khagaya Namaha Eight-limbed salutation ( Ashtanga namaskara ) – Om Pushne Namaha Cobra pose ( Bhujangasana ) – Om Hiranyagarbhaya Namaha Mountain pose ( Parvatasana ) – Om Marichaye Namaha Equestrian pose - left leg forward ( Ashwa sanchalanasana ) – Om Adityaya Namaha Standing forward bend ( Padahastasana ) – Om Savitre Namaha Raised arms pose ( Hastauttanasana ) – Om Arkaya Namaha Prayer pose ( Pranamasana ) – Om Bhaskaraya Namaha Can children practice surya namaskar? Yes. Children can practice surya namaskar under adult supervision to ensure they do so with the right technique and posture. In fact, children are gifted with more flexibility than adults, which is why practising surya namaskars from early childhood can enhance their physical strength and improve their mental focus. Is it necessary to warm up before doing surya namaskar? Doing a light walk, jog, or some stretches before surya namaskar (or any other exercise) will ensure that your muscles receive adequate blood flow and your joints are ready for extra physical load. Can surya namaskar reduce belly fat? When combined with a healthy diet, positive lifestyle changes, and adequate calorie deficit, surya namaskar can be an effective way to lose belly fat. It is a full-body workout. However, only doing surya namaskar cannot help with spot reduction. This exercise does engage the abdominal muscles but actual fat loss is only possible through consistent physical activity, strength training, and a balanced diet. Can I practice surya namaskar indoors? Definitely. You only need a nice, clean space where you can move around freely. Can surya namaskar help in weight loss? As discussed above, doing surya namaskar regularly is a great way of losing body fat and maintaining a healthy BMI. You can burn almost 14 calories with every round of surya namaskar . With time, your body becomes more efficient in utilising energy, which is essential for losing weight. Can I do surya namaskar during periods? Doing surya namaskar during periods is a personal choice and depends on how you feel. If you regularly experience severe cramps, fatigue, or heavy flow during your period, it's best to rest or do very gentle movements. In such instances, avoid deep forward bends or high-intensity rounds so that you do not experience pressure on the abdomen. If you have PCOS, endometriosis, or fibroids, it's best to consult your doctor before you practise surya namaskar . Can I take a bath immediately after doing surya namaskar? It is best to wait a while before you take a bath after your surya namaskar routine. This will allow your warmed-up body to cool down gently and prevent it from being exposed to sudden shifts in temperature. Wait for 20-30 minutes post-exercise before you head to the showers.

        "We have sent a passcode to above number. Please enter your code.",
        "Let’s answer this right away—a medium-sized roti contains up to 106 calories, 22.32g of carbohydrates, 3.84g to 5.28g of protein, 2.84g of fibre, and 0.52g of fats.",
        "It’s a delight to eat piping hot rotis with some delicious homemade sabzi (vegetables) and dals (lentils).",
        "Roti, also known as chapati, phulka, or poli in different regions of India, is an unleavened flatbread usually made with whole wheat flour, water, salt, and a little fat (oil/ghee).",
        "It is a staple meal in most Indian households and a primary source of energy. Remember how it was the go-to lunch box meal?",
        "However, is it all still the same?",
        "Today, you are probably looking at the hot roti, topped with ghee, and wondering if even one roti will add some grams to your weight.",
        "Maybe, you are struggling to count the calories in one roti - and that is stopping you from enjoying a satisfying, nostalgia-filled meal.",
        "The ingredients in the roti—wheat flour, water, salt, and oil/ghee are usually healthy when we eat them in moderate amounts.",
        "However, in excessive amounts or under certain conditions, these ingredients can have undesirable effects on our health.",
        "But, several factors influence the calorie content of rotis—the type of flour used, size, thickness, and even cooking methods.",
        "But does this mean that roti isn’t good for you? This is far from the truth.",
        "If you are an avid weight watcher, read on to find out how roti benefits your health, how you can lose weight by eating it, and how you can make it healthier.",
        "Rotis are not only filling, but are equally nutritious.",
        "With 106 calories in one roti, 22.32g carbs, 3.84g to 5.28g protein, 2.84g dietary fibre, and just 0.52g fat, roti is surely nutritious, provided you eat it in moderate amounts.",
        "Let’s see the nutrients in one roti*:",
        "*The values discussed here are for one medium-sized, whole wheat roti.",
        "Did you know?",
        "Multigrain rotis are more nutritious[1] compared to regular wheat rotis. They are a blend of whole grains like wheat, jowar, bajra, and more. With a moderate glycemic index (55-69) and 70-85 calories in one multigrain roti, they prevent huge spikes in blood sugar.",
        "Rotis are largely made of wheat flour, but wheat isn’t the only kind of flour out there. You can experiment with rotis made from different flours.",
        "So before you decide how many chapatis/rotis to eat, it is important to know how many calories you would be consuming if you usually have more than one roti.",
        "These are approximate values for a medium-sized (18 cm diameter or 40g) chapatis/roti:",
        "The calorie count for a roti/chapati will change if it differs in size or is topped with add-on calories.",
        "For instance, calories in roti without ghee will be less than calories in roti with ghee.",
        "Or, 3 small chapati calories may be equal to 1 big chapati calories.",
        "All of it boils down to how you prefer to eat your rotis.",
        "Understanding this will either take a masterclass in roti nutrition or you may just have to step into the kitchen with a weighing scale and count the calories in chapatis/roti the right way.",
        "The short, and perhaps the only answer you need to hear - No, it doesn’t!",
        "The answer is also the same for mangoes, ghee, avocados, parathas, or basically anything you eat.",
        "The real culprit here is not following healthy practices like portion control, balanced workout, sleeping well, and maintaining a calorie deficit.",
        "So, is roti healthy?",
        "Fitness and lifestyle coach Arjhan Rai says, “Roti is just a food. It's not going to make you fat or thin. You need to understand your calorie intake and then you can eat whatever you want and still lose weight.”",
        "He also explains this with an interesting logic in his Instagram post.",
        "TL;DR? Roti comes with some heavy calories. If you want to switch to healthier alternatives, check out our web story below.",
        "Looks interesting, right? Check out more web stories as well!",
        "While most people enjoy eating wheat rotis, there are certain instances where it is helpful to seek alternatives:",
        "Whether roti is healthy or not has been a very controversial topic in health circles. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make it any healthier.",
        "Curious how to do so? Check out these super useful tips to explore healthy alternatives to roti:",
        "If you need more healthy alternatives to roti or explore healthy ways to reduce the amount of calories in chapatis, check out this interesting and ‘nutrient-packed’ thread on Reddit:",
        "When eaten right, a roti nourishes you with essential nutrients and keeps you energised throughout the day.",
        "But like any food that is mostly carbs, pair it with sufficient protein, fibre, and fats so you can balance your meals and avoid excess snacking.",
        "While making your rotis, prefer whole grain varieties over refined atta whenever possible, and you are good to go!",
        "Finding the perfect balance in your diet is just one part of your weight loss plans. If weight management is on your to-do list, Aktive is here for you.",
        "Our experts understand that every person is unique, and we're here to guide you with hassle-free, evidence-based weight loss plans that do not ask you to starve yourself and yet, help you reach your desired weight.",
        "Can multigrain rotis help with weight loss?",
        "Yes. Multigrain rotis are a healthy way to lose weight, as they are rich in dietary fibre, which reduces hunger levels.",
        "Multigrain rotis are usually made from a mix of wheat, chickpea flour, millets, bajra, barley, oats, ragi, maize, and jowar (sorghum) flour.",
        "They also have a lower glycemic index compared to refined wheat atta rotis, which means your blood sugar levels wouldn't spike as much. Both these mechanisms are important for helping you lose weight.",
        "Are multigrain rotis gluten-free?",
        "This depends on the type of grain that has been used to make the flour. If they contain a significant portion of wheat flour, they wouldn't be gluten-free.",
        "On the other hand, using only gluten-free flour like bajra, ragi, jowar, millet flour, etc., are more suitable for people with gluten sensitivity.",
        "How does the size of a roti affect its calorie count?",
        "The bigger the roti, the more calories are in it. For example, a medium-sized roti (approximately 40 grams) contains around 112 calories.",
        "As the size increases, so will the amount of flour and other ingredients used. Also, a smaller roti might be just as unhealthy as a bigger one if one applies too much ghee/oil to it.",
        "What you put inside or outside the roti also affects the calorie count.",
        "This is why we need to be mindful of our portions to manage the overall calorie intake.",
        "What’s healthier: Roti or rice?",
        "In this case, 'healthy' can mean different things to people with different dietary needs. Roti (especially wheat or multigrain) is usually healthier due to its high fibre and protein content, but someone with gluten sensitivity can't eat the same roti.",
        "In such cases, rice can be a better alternative as it is a complex carbohydrate, gluten-free, and has some protein. In this case, you can combine it with adequate amounts of vegetables, dals, salad, and buttermilk, which increases its nutrient value.",
        "Is it okay to eat roti every day?",
        "Yes, you can surely eat roti every day, but eat it in limited amounts and pair it with sabzi, dal, salad, curd, or buttermilk. Eating roti daily takes care of our energy needs and provides fibre, nutrients, and healthy fats to the body.",
        "Is ghee roti bad for you?",
        "When taken in moderation, ghee is certainly a healthy addition to your meals. In fact, doctors recommend eating upto a teaspoonful of ghee every day for good health.",
        "Applying ghee to roti adds flavour and essential fatty acids to it. But yes, its high-fat content can add to your daily calorie intake (1 ghee roti carries approximately 126-165 calories), ultimately leading to weight gain. This can be avoided by eating ghee roti in moderation.",
        "How many calories are in a plain roti with sabzi (vegetable curry)?",
        "A plain roti paired with sabzi will increase the total roti calories to 170-300. This depends on the ingredients of the sabzi and how it's made. Eating sabzi made with less oil will add some good calories to your diet.",
        "How many rotis should I eat for weight loss?",
        "The number of rotis one needs to eat for weight loss may vary according to one's present health condition, dietary needs, and activity levels. As a rule, you can have 1-2 rotis or phulkas with every meal to lose weight.",
        "You can also eat rotis made of jowar, bajra, or ragi flour or mix them with some parts of wheat flour to add more fibre and nutrients to your meal.",
        "What are some low-calorie side dishes to pair with roti?",
        "Some low-calorie dishes you can enjoy with roti include:",
        "Can you freeze rotis to save cooking time during the week?",
        "Yes, you can prepare rotis in advance and freeze them. Roll the roti dough as usual, but only half-cook them on both sides. Once done, store the rotis together in a zip-lock bag or an airtight container.",
        "Place parchment paper or cling film between every roti so that they don't stick. You can reheat them on a non-stick tawa or microwave them for 15-20 seconds and enjoy.",
        "How much protein does a roti have?",

In this article: Key takeaways: Is whole wheat roti really nutritious? What different types of rotis are out there? Chapati/Roti math: Calories edition The big question: Will roti make me fat? Who should avoid eating roti? How to make your rotis healthier? Wrapping it up Key takeaways: A medium-sized whole-wheat roti (approx. 40g in weight) provides 106 calories and has a good balance of macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Roti is a versatile meal and can be made from rice flour, jowar, bajra, millet, etc. Multigrain rotis are more nutritious than plain rotis. The calories in 1 roti will vary with its size and what you eat it with. For example, having dal or sabzi with roti will increase the total calorie count to 170-300 calories . It’s a delight to eat piping hot rotis with some delicious homemade sabzi (vegetables) and dals (lentils). Roti , also known as chapati , phulka , or poli in different regions of India, is an unleavened flatbread usually made with whole wheat flour, water, salt, and a little fat (oil/ ghee ). It is a staple meal in most Indian households and a primary source of energy. Remember how it was the go-to lunch box meal? However, is it all still the same? Today, you are probably looking at the hot roti , topped with ghee , and wondering if even one roti will add some grams to your weight. Maybe, you are struggling to count the calories in one roti - and that is stopping you from enjoying a satisfying, nostalgia-filled meal. The ingredients in the roti —wheat flour, water, salt, and oil/ ghee are usually healthy when we eat them in moderate amounts. However, in excessive amounts or under certain conditions, these ingredients can have undesirable effects on our health. But, several factors influence the calorie content of rotis —the type of flour used, size, thickness, and even cooking methods. But does this mean that roti isn’t good for you? This is far from the truth. If you are an avid weight watcher, read on to find out how roti benefits your health, how you can lose weight by eating it, and how you can make it healthier. Is whole wheat roti really nutritious? Rotis are not only filling, but are equally nutritious. With 106 calories in one roti , 22.32g carbs, 3.84g to 5.28g protein, 2.84g dietary fibre, and just 0.52g fat, roti is surely nutritious, provided you eat it in moderate amounts. Let’s see the nutrients in one roti *: *The values discussed here are for one medium-sized, whole wheat roti . Did you know? Multigrain rotis are more nutritious [1] compared to regular wheat rotis. They are a blend of whole grains like wheat, jowar , bajra , and more. With a moderate glycemic index (55-69) and 70-85 calories in one multigrain roti , they prevent huge spikes in blood sugar. What different types of rotis are out there? Rotis are largely made of wheat flour, but wheat isn’t the only kind of flour out there. You can experiment with rotis made from different flours. 11 different types of rotis in India Roti made with whole wheat flour Served with dals, sabzis, chutney, or plain milk Calories: 106 kcal Thick roti made from jowar (sorghum) Gluten-free, fibre-rich, low glycaemic index Calories: 56.8 kcal Roti made from bajra (pearl millet) Rich in fibre, minerals, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids Calories: 119 kcal Gluten-free roti made from rice flour Soft and easy to digest Calories: 83 kcal Roti made using chickpea flour ( besan ) Rich in protein and fibre Calories: 104 kcal Found in dhabas pan-India Roti cooked in a clay oven ( tandoor ) Calories: 85 kcal Roti made from maize ( makka ) flour Rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre Calories: 90 kcal Roti made from finger millet ( ragi ) High in protein, fibre, calcium, and iron Calories: 64-87 kcal Pancake made from tapioca pearls ( sabudana ) Gluten-free and fast-friendly Calories: 120-132 kcal Popular in Maharashtra Flatbread made with mix of jowar , bajra , and aata Calories: 100 kcal Thick flatbread popular in Gujarat Made from whole wheat/millet flour Calories: 130 kcal Chapati/Roti math: Calories edition So before you decide how many chapatis/rotis to eat, it is important to know how many calories you would be consuming if you usually have more than one roti. These are approximate values for a medium-sized (18 cm diameter or 40g) chapatis/roti : Half a roti/chapati will contain upto 53 calories 1 roti/chapati has upto 106 calories 2 rotis/chapatis have upto 212 calories 3 rotis/chapatis have upto 318 calories 4 rotis/chapatis have upto 424 calories 6 rotis/chapatis may contain upto 636 calories The calorie count for a roti/chapati will change if it differs in size or is topped with add-on calories. For instance, calories in roti without ghee will be less than calories in roti with ghee . Or, 3 small chapati calories may be equal to 1 big chapati calories. All of it boils down to how you prefer to eat your rotis . Understanding this will either take a masterclass in roti nutrition or you may just have to step into the kitchen with a weighing scale and count the calories in chapatis/roti the right way. The big question: Will roti make me fat? The short, and perhaps the only answer you need to hear - No, it doesn’t! The answer is also the same for mangoes, ghee , avocados, parathas , or basically anything you eat. The real culprit here is not following healthy practices like portion control, balanced workout, sleeping well, and maintaining a calorie deficit. So, is roti healthy? Fitness and lifestyle coach Arjhan Rai says, “ Roti is just a food. It's not going to make you fat or thin. You need to understand your calorie intake and then you can eat whatever you want and still lose weight.” He also explains this with an interesting logic in his Instagram post. TL;DR? Roti comes with some heavy calories. If you want to switch to healthier alternatives, check out our web story below. Looks interesting, right? Check out more web stories as well! Who should avoid eating roti? While most people enjoy eating wheat rotis , there are certain instances where it is helpful to seek alternatives: Those affected with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine). People with diabetes . Weight-conscious individuals following a low-carb or keto diet . Wheat allergy or Non-celiac wheat sensitivity [2] - An allergic reaction can happen to any kind of component in the wheat grain. It may sound similar to gluten sensitivity, but the latter condition is restricted to the protein itself and shows up as gastric discomfort. How to make your rotis healthier? Whether roti is healthy or not has been a very controversial topic in health circles. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make it any healthier. Curious how to do so?

Our experts understand that every person is unique, and we're here to guide you with hassle-free, evidence-based weight loss plans that do not ask you to starve yourself and yet, help you reach your desired weight. FAQs Can multigrain rotis help with weight loss? Yes. Multigrain rotis are a healthy way to lose weight, as they are rich in dietary fibre , which reduces hunger levels. Multigrain rotis are usually made from a mix of wheat, chickpea flour, millets, bajra, barley, oats, ragi, maize, and jowar (sorghum) flour. They also have a lower glycemic index compared to refined wheat atta rotis , which means your blood sugar levels wouldn't spike as much. Both these mechanisms are important for helping you lose weight. Are multigrain rotis gluten-free? This depends on the type of grain that has been used to make the flour. If they contain a significant portion of wheat flour, they wouldn't be gluten-free. On the other hand, using only gluten-free flour like bajra, ragi, jowar, millet flour, etc., are more suitable for people with gluten sensitivity. How does the size of a roti affect its calorie count? The bigger the roti, the more calories are in it. For example, a medium-sized roti (approximately 40 grams) contains around 112 calories . As the size increases, so will the amount of flour and other ingredients used. Also, a smaller roti might be just as unhealthy as a bigger one if one applies too much ghee/oil to it. What you put inside or outside the roti also affects the calorie count. This is why we need to be mindful of our portions to manage the overall calorie intake. What’s healthier: Roti or rice? In this case, 'healthy' can mean different things to people with different dietary needs. Roti (especially wheat or multigrain) is usually healthier due to its high fibre and protein content , but someone with gluten sensitivity can't eat the same roti . In such cases, rice can be a better alternative as it is a complex carbohydrate, gluten-free, and has some protein. In this case, you can combine it with adequate amounts of vegetables, dals, salad, and buttermilk, which increases its nutrient value. Is it okay to eat roti every day? Yes, you can surely eat roti every day, but eat it in limited amounts and pair it with sabzi, dal, salad, curd, or buttermilk. Eating roti daily takes care of our energy needs and provides fibre, nutrients, and healthy fats to the body. Is ghee roti bad for you? When taken in moderation, ghee is certainly a healthy addition to your meals. In fact, doctors recommend eating upto a teaspoonful of ghee every day for good health. Applying ghee to roti adds flavour and essential fatty acids to it. But yes, its high-fat content can add to your daily calorie intake ( 1 ghee roti carries approximately 126-165 calories ), ultimately leading to weight gain. This can be avoided by eating ghee roti in moderation. How many calories are in a plain roti with sabzi (vegetable curry)? A plain roti paired with sabzi will increase the total roti calories to 170-300 . This depends on the ingredients of the sabzi and how it's made. Eating sabzi made with less oil will add some good calories to your diet. How many rotis should I eat for weight loss? The number of rotis one needs to eat for weight loss may vary according to one's present health condition, dietary needs, and activity levels. As a rule, you can have 1-2 rotis or phulkas with every meal to lose weight . You can also eat rotis made of jowar, bajra, or ragi flour or mix them with some parts of wheat flour to add more fibre and nutrients to your meal. What are some low-calorie side dishes to pair with roti? Some low-calorie dishes you can enjoy with roti include: Vegetable raita (a yoghurt-based dish with cucumbers or other veggies) Tomato or cucumber salad Steamed vegetables Dal (lentils) Paneer bhurji (a dish made from scrambled paneer that adds the right dose of protein) Can you freeze rotis to save cooking time during the week? Yes, you can prepare rotis in advance and freeze them. Roll the roti dough as usual, but only half-cook them on both sides. Once done, store the rotis together in a zip-lock bag or an airtight container. Place parchment paper or cling film between every roti so that they don't stick. You can reheat them on a non-stick tawa or microwave them for 15-20 seconds and enjoy. How much protein does a roti have? 1 medium-sized whole wheat roti (approx. 40g in weight) contains around 3.84g to 5.28g of protein . This is dependent on the flour used and the preparation method. For example, a roti made with besan (chickpea flour) or multigrain atta can have slightly higher amounts of protein. If you are wondering how to balance out your overall protein intake throughout the day, you can use these pointers as a general guideline: 1 roti/chapati contains about 3.84g to 5.28g of protein . 4 rotis/chapatis contain about 15.36g to 21.12g of protein .

        "If you are worried about gaining extra weight after eating mangoes, a Reddit post shares ways to compensate your love for mangoes smartly instead of resisting it.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "According to expert cardiologist Dr. Bimal Chhajer, mangoes have natural sugars and fall under the medium glycaemic index category (56). They also have a low glycaemic load of 8.4",
        "This means that mangoes are a safe choice of fruit, but people with diabetes should eat them in small portions, and avoid consuming them in juice or dried form. Pairing them with adequate protein and fibre can also help control blood sugar.",

        "Can I eat mangoes during intermittent fasting?",
        "Yes, mangoes can be enjoyed during your eating window, but they must be avoided during fasting.",
        "They’re rich in natural sugars and calories, so if you’re doing something like a 16:8 fast, eat ½ to 1 cup of mango between 12 and 8 pm, and pair it with protein or fat to avoid sudden sugar spikes. Don’t go overboard; too much fruit sugar may interfere with fat burning or ketosis.",
        "Is it safe to eat mango peel?",
        "Mango peels are rich in antioxidants, fibre, and compounds like mangiferin that support immunity and inflammation control. That said, they’re not commonly eaten, and for good reason. The peel may taste different, be hard to digest, and contain pesticide residues.",
        "Some people may also react to a compound in the peel called urushiol (also found in poison ivy and cashews), which can trigger rashes or allergies.",
        "Unless you're using organic mangoes, washing them thoroughly, and have no sensitivity, it’s better to peel them, especially when serving children, pregnant women, or those with gut issues.",
        "Can I eat mangoes if I have PCOS?",
        "Mangoes are safe for people with PCOS if eaten in moderation. They offer antioxidants like quercetin, vitamin C, and a decent dose of fibre, all of which help manage inflammation and insulin resistance.",

        "I have thyroid. Can I eat mangoes?",
        "Yes, mangoes are generally safe for people with thyroid disorders. They’re a good source of antioxidants, vitamin A, and even trace amounts of iodine, all of which support thyroid function.",
        "They also don’t contain strong goitrogens, so there’s little risk of interference. Just be careful with timing. You can have a mango at least one hour after taking your thyroid medication, like levothyroxine, to avoid absorption issues.",
        "Which is better, raw or ripe mango?",
        "Raw mango has fewer sugars, a lower glycaemic index (GI), and fewer calories, making it better for weight loss, PCOS, or sugar control. It also works beautifully in pickles, salads, and chutneys.",
        "Conversely, ripe mango is sweeter and richer in antioxidants like mangiferin and vitamin C. It’s excellent for general nutrition but needs portion control, especially for those managing weight or diabetes.",
        "I have irritable bowel syndrome. Can I eat mangoes?",
        "Mangoes can be eaten by people with IBS or FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) sensitivities, but it's best to have them in tiny portions. While the fibre in mangoes might be helpful for some digestion concerns, their FODMAP content could cause some digestive discomfort.",
        "You can limit your intake to ¼ cup (about 30–50g) of mangoes, particularly during the initial phases of a low-FODMAP diet.",
        "Working with a dietitian can be helpful in identifying your specific triggers. It's also a good idea to gradually introduce mangoes and perhaps avoid them if experiencing an IBS flare-up.",
        "Can children eat mangoes?",
        "Mangoes are great for kids as they are sweet and nutrient-rich. Just watch out for the sugar (it can affect teeth) and allergies (like to cashews).",
        "Cut them into small bits to avoid choking, stick to a small amount (like ¼ cups for little ones, ½ cups for bigger kids), maybe once or twice a day, and rinse their mouths afterwards.",
        "Is it safe to eat mangoes during pregnancy?",
        "Yes, a pregnant woman can eat mangoes during her pregnancy in moderation. Mangoes are a good source of iron, folic acid, fibre, and vitamins (A, B6, & C). These nutrients are essential for neural tube development, immunity, and digestive health.",
        "However, they are also high in natural sugars, which may increase the chances of getting gestational diabetes. Always consult your doctor or nutritionist before making mangoes a part of your diet.",
        "Does eating mango have any side effects?",
        "Eating something as healthy as a mango has a bright side and a downside. Let’s take a quick look at the latter:",
        "What factors affect the calorie content of mangoes?",
        "Some factors have a significant effect on the calorie content of mangoes:",
        "Do different mango varieties have different calorie counts?",
        "Yes, the calorie content can vary among mango varieties due to differences in sugar, water, and other nutrients.",
        "For example,",
        "Which fruit is better for workout fuel, a mango or a banana?",
        "Both mangoes and bananas can be good workout fuel! Mangoes might give you a quicker energy boost because of their sugar, which is excellent if you need something fast before a shorter workout.",
        "On the other hand, bananas have more carbs and potassium, which can help you sustain through longer workouts and help your muscles recover better.",
        "How not to eat mangoes?",
        "Ayurvedic and Unani medicine expert Dr. Saleem Zaidi suggests that combining mango with certain foods is not so beneficial for the body. This food incompatibility (viruddha aahar) can affect digestion. He recommends the following:",
        "If you're into Ayurveda, these suggestions might help keep you comfortable. Otherwise, listen to your body and determine what works best for you.",
        "Is aamras healthy?",
        "Aamras can be a healthy treat in moderation. It gives you fibre, good vitamins, and antioxidants. However, if you add sugar or ghee, it can become high in calories. So, if you're watching your weight or blood sugar, it's something to be mindful of.",
        "To make aamras healthier, try using just the natural sweetness of ripe mangoes without adding extra sugar or ghee. Eating a small portion (like half a cup) with some protein or a low-GI food like roti is a good way to balance things.",
        "If you have concerns about blood sugar or weight, enjoying it once or twice a week might be helpful. Having a chat with a dietitian could give you even more personalised advice.",
        "How to reduce toxicity from mangoes?",
        "You can follow these four tips to ensure your mangoes are clean before consuming:",

What are the health benefits of mangoes? Did you know that not just mango pulp, but also mango seeds and leaves benefit your health? Check out how: Prevent cell damage and inflammation Natural compounds like mangiferin, quercetin, and gallic acid prevent cell damage and other inflammatory diseases. Boosts immunity With a good amount of vitamin C and A, natural antibacterial and antifungal compounds, mangoes help your body fight off infections and tackle harmful microbes. Keeps the gut healthy The fibre in mango improves bowel movements, supports gut health, and helps you feel light and comfortable after meals. Improves vision The beta-carotene in mango converts to vitamin A, essential for healthy eyesight, and prevents night blindness and age-related blindness. Keeps your skin healthy Antioxidants and vitamin C improve collagen production, give your skin a natural glow, and slow ageing. Helps control blood sugar Certain compounds, especially in the mango’s peel, help slow sugar absorption and reduce sudden blood sugar spikes. Protects the liver Mango seed extract may shield the liver from toxins and may support its healing. Prevents cancer In a study [1] , mango’s bioactive compounds may stop the growth of specific cancer cells, including colon, breast, and cervical cancer cells. Improves heart health The potassium, fibre, and antioxidants help maintain healthy blood pressure and circulation, thereby improving heart health. Helps during diarrhoea Mango seed extract can help slow excessive gut movement and reduce fluid loss during diarrhoea episodes. Cools the body in summer Green mango helps maintain electrolyte balance, prevents dehydration, and protects against heatstroke. Are mangoes good for weight loss? The relationship between mangoes and weight loss might be complicated. How can one even resist the temptation? However, a study [2] suggests that mangoes can help you lose weight when eaten smartly. Here’s how: Mangoes have a high water and fibre content , filling you up faster without adding calories. The fibre also slows digestion , steadies your blood sugar, and keeps cravings in check. Mango’s bioactive compounds, like mangiferin, quercetin, catechins, and gallic acid, can fight oxidative stress, which helps minimise weight gain and insulin resistance . In human [3] and animal studies [4] , these compounds have been shown to: Reduce fat buildup. Stop new fat cells from forming. Increase fat breakdown (lipolysis). Mangiferin, found in higher amounts in mango peel and seed, may help regulate fat metabolism , support insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation. Polyphenols might improve gut bacteria , which help us digest food, burn calories, and even store fat. All of this sounds promising, but there is one caveat: Most of these findings come from high-dose extracts tested in animals or lab conditions, not from eating a few mango slices. The mango pulp we eat has much lower concentrations of these compounds. Human studies are still catching up, and we need more research to know what these benefits look like in daily life. If you are worried about gaining extra weight after eating mangoes, a Reddit post shares ways to compensate your love for mangoes smartly instead of resisting it. Is mango good for diabetes? Yes, it is. According to expert cardiologist Dr. Bimal Chhajer , mangoes have natural sugars and fall under the medium glycaemic index category (56). They also have a low glycaemic load of 8.4 Glycaemic index (GI) shows how fast a food spikes blood sugar. Glycaemic load (GL) shows how much blood sugar a portion of food will actually spike. This means that mangoes are a safe choice of fruit , but people with diabetes should eat them in small portions, and avoid consuming them in juice or dried form. Pairing them with adequate protein and fibre can also help control blood sugar. 5 healthy mango recipes to try for weight loss Are you ready to sweeten your weight loss journey?

Yes , mangoes can be enjoyed during your eating window, but they must be avoided during fasting. They’re rich in natural sugars and calories, so if you’re doing something like a 16:8 fast, eat ½ to 1 cup of mango between 12 and 8 pm, and pair it with protein or fat to avoid sudden sugar spikes . Don’t go overboard; too much fruit sugar may interfere with fat burning or ketosis. Is it safe to eat mango peel? Mango peels are rich in antioxidants, fibre, and compounds like mangiferin that support immunity and inflammation control. That said, they’re not commonly eaten , and for good reason. The peel may taste different, be hard to digest, and contain pesticide residues . Some people may also react to a compound in the peel called urushiol (also found in poison ivy and cashews), which can trigger rashes or allergies. Unless you're using organic mangoes, washing them thoroughly, and have no sensitivity, it’s better to peel them, especially when serving children, pregnant women, or those with gut issues. Can I eat mangoes if I have PCOS? Mangoes are safe for people with PCOS if eaten in moderation . They offer antioxidants like quercetin, vitamin C, and a decent dose of fibre, all of which help manage inflammation and insulin resistance. The key is portion control and timing. This helps slow sugar absorption and keeps cravings in check. But yes, too much mango can spike blood sugar and add to calorie load, so enjoy it smartly. I have thyroid. Can I eat mangoes? Yes, mangoes are generally safe for people with thyroid disorders . They’re a good source of antioxidants, vitamin A, and even trace amounts of iodine, all of which support thyroid function. They also don’t contain strong goitrogens, so there’s little risk of interference. Just be careful with timing. You can have a mango at least one hour after taking your thyroid medication, like levothyroxine, to avoid absorption issues. Which is better, raw or ripe mango? Raw mango has fewer sugars, a lower glycaemic index (GI), and fewer calories , making it better for weight loss, PCOS, or sugar control. It also works beautifully in pickles, salads, and chutneys. Conversely, ripe mango is sweeter and richer in antioxidants like mangiferin and vitamin C . It’s excellent for general nutrition but needs portion control, especially for those managing weight or diabetes. I have irritable bowel syndrome. Can I eat mangoes? Mangoes can be eaten by people with IBS or FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) sensitivities , but it's best to have them in tiny portions. While the fibre in mangoes might be helpful for some digestion concerns, their FODMAP content could cause some digestive discomfort. You can limit your intake to ¼ cup (about 30–50g) of mangoes, particularly during the initial phases of a low-FODMAP diet. Working with a dietitian can be helpful in identifying your specific triggers. It's also a good idea to gradually introduce mangoes and perhaps avoid them if experiencing an IBS flare-up. Can children eat mangoes? Mangoes are great for kids as they are sweet and nutrient-rich . Just watch out for the sugar (it can affect teeth) and allergies (like to cashews). Cut them into small bits to avoid choking, stick to a small amount (like ¼ cups for little ones, ½ cups for bigger kids), maybe once or twice a day, and rinse their mouths afterwards. Is it safe to eat mangoes during pregnancy? Yes, a pregnant woman can eat mangoes during her pregnancy in moderation . Mangoes are a good source of iron, folic acid, fibre, and vitamins (A, B6, & C). These nutrients are essential for neural tube development, immunity, and digestive health. However, they are also high in natural sugars, which may increase the chances of getting gestational diabetes. Always consult your doctor or nutritionist before making mangoes a part of your diet. Does eating mango have any side effects? Eating something as healthy as a mango has a bright side and a downside. Let’s take a quick look at the latter: Mangoes may cause weight gain if eaten in excess. High fibre content in mangoes can trigger bloating, gas, cramps, and even diarrhoea in some people. The fermentable sugar in the fruit may trigger Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS symptoms. Mangoes may cause more spikes in blood sugar levels if not eaten in limited portions. Some people with latex allergy have shown a 'mango-allergy' . It may manifest as itchy skin and hives, or become severe as anaphylaxis, throat swelling, and difficulty breathing. In some places, mangoes are treated with pesticides or artificial ripening agents (like calcium carbide). They can harm our health if the fruit is not washed properly. What factors affect the calorie content of mangoes? Some factors have a significant effect on the calorie content of mangoes: Size : The larger the size, more are the calories. Ripeness : Ripe mangoes have slightly more calories due to their higher sugar content. Variety : Some varieties of mango may be sweeter due to their sugar and water content. Serving size : Larger portions can increase the calorie count. Preparation : Dried and canned mangoes will have more calories (for the same serving size) as the sugar is present in more concentrated amounts. Do different mango varieties have different calorie counts? Yes, the calorie content can vary among mango varieties due to differences in sugar, water, and other nutrients. For example, The Langra variety has approximately 67.57 calories per 100 g . Chausa mango provides about 100.26 calories per 100 g . Himsagor mango contains around 46.14 calories . Amrapali mango has the highest calorie count at 112.12 calories per 100 g of the edible portion. Which fruit is better for workout fuel, a mango or a banana? Both mangoes and bananas can be good workout fuel! Mangoes might give you a quicker energy boost because of their sugar, which is excellent if you need something fast before a shorter workout. On the other hand, bananas have more carbs and potassium, which can help you sustain through longer workouts and help your muscles recover better. How not to eat mangoes? Ayurvedic and Unani medicine expert Dr. Saleem Zaidi suggests that combining mango with certain foods is not so beneficial for the body. This food incompatibility (viruddha aahar) can affect digestion. He recommends the following: Don’t mix mango with citrus fruits or bananas it slows digestion and causes gas or acidity. Avoid pairing mango with milk, curd, or lassi. It can weaken digestion and lead to bloating or weight gain. Do not drink water, cold drinks, tea, or coffee right after mango. It may lead to vomiting, stomach pain, and bloating. Skip spicy, sour foods or karela before/after eating mango . This may trigger indigestion, allergies, or nausea. If you're into Ayurveda, these suggestions might help keep you comfortable. Otherwise, listen to your body and determine what works best for you. Is aamras healthy? Aamras can be a healthy treat in moderation . It gives you fibre, good vitamins, and antioxidants. However, if you add sugar or ghee, it can become high in calories. So, if you're watching your weight or blood sugar, it's something to be mindful of. To make aamras healthier , try using just the natural sweetness of ripe mangoes without adding extra sugar or ghee. Eating a small portion (like half a cup) with some protein or a low-GI food like roti is a good way to balance things. If you have concerns about blood sugar or weight, enjoying it once or twice a week might be helpful. Having a chat with a dietitian could give you even more personalised advice.

Antioxidant support: The bioactive compounds in apples protect you from heart disease by reducing harmful radicals and molecules that cause inflammation. Antioxidants also improve how the body metabolises fats. Controls blood sugar: In apples, polyphenols (quercetin and anthocyanin) help the body use insulin better and stabilise blood sugar. They also help prevent the liver from releasing too much glucose into the bloodstream. May prevent colon cancer: Flavonoids and polyphenols in apples may help prevent colon cancer by fighting free radical damage and slowing the growth of cancer cells. Liver detox: Help the liver produce more glutathione, which is needed to flush out harmful toxins. Stronger bones: A unique compound called phloridzin helps improve bone density and protect it from further damage (especially in post-menopausal women).

In this blog, we will see how chia seeds help with weight loss, their benefits, the best time to eat them, and 9 easy, lip-smacking chia seeds recipes for weight loss. What are chia seeds? With obesity on the rise, finding sustainable ways to manage weight has become more important than ever. Foods rich in protein, fibre, and Omega-3 are key to this, and chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) perfectly fit the bill. Also known as a “novel food,” chia seeds are used in functional foods (FOSHU) and dietary supplements because of their extensive health benefits. Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds with roots in Mexico and Central America. Many have enjoyed them for over 5,000 years. Today, you can find them in everything from drinks and baked goods to cereals and snacks. What makes chia seeds so nutritious? Chia seeds are a superfood because they are packed [1] (read, loaded) with nutrients. Chia seeds are rich in: Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids Dietary fibre: Includes both soluble and insoluble fibre. Protein Antioxidants: Contains powerful compounds like quercetin, myricetin, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid. Minerals: Rich in magnesium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Vitamins: Includes vitamins A, E, B1, and B2. Let’s see how these nutrients help us stay fit and healthy. How do chia seeds help with weight loss? Here’s how chia seeds help you lose weight: Keeps you feeling full longer: Chia seeds are loaded with fibre (34 grams of fibre per 100 grams), especially soluble fibre. As a result, digestion slows down, you feel fuller for longer, and you do not experience hunger pangs. Low calories, high nutrients: Despite their rich nutritional profile, chia seeds are low in calories , so you can sneak them into your meals guilt-free. Stabilizes blood sugar: A study [2] revealed that chia seeds can slow down the body's release of sugar after eating. This helps keep blood sugar steady after meals and control hunger pangs. Packs in protein: With all nine essential amino acids present, chia seeds offer the much-desired protein. Protein makes you feel full and helps reduce your appetite. Loaded with healthy fats: The healthy fats present in chia seeds keep your energy up and your hunger down. Keeps you hydrated: When chia seeds absorb water (up to 12 times their weight !), they help with hydration and digestion. Plus, that added water helps keep your stomach feeling full, which can naturally reduce your appetite. Chia seeds can effectively help you lose weight [3] when combined with a calorie-restricted diet. So why not add these tiny seeds to your diet to support your weight loss journey? Here’s what studies say To see how chia seeds can be an easy way to support weight loss, a study [4] was done on 46 adults with type 2 diabetes and high BMI (25 and above). One group took 40 grams of chia seeds daily (with their regular diet), while the other group (control) continued their usual diet. After 12 weeks, the scientists observed that the group that ate chia seeds lost 1.23 kg of weight as compared to the group that followed their usual diet. In another instance, 77 type 2 diabetics aged 35-75 took part in a 6-month study [3] . They followed a calorie-restricted diet, with a reduction of 500 calories per day. One group ate 30 grams of ground salba -chia daily, while the other group had a blend of oat bran, inulin, and maltodextrin every day. The group on a chia seed diet not only lost more weight but also saw a bigger drop in waist size. The group on a chia seed diet lost 1.9 kg of weight at the end of the study, compared to the group on an oat-bran diet, which lost 0.3 kg of weight. The former group also dropped 3.5 cm from their waist size, compared to the latter group, who dropped only 1.1 cm from their waist size. It was a simple change, but it made a real difference for them. How many chia seeds should I eat per day? Supplementing your diet with 25 gms to 30 gms or 2-3 tablespoons of chia seeds every day is enough to meet your nutritional needs. What is the best time to have chia seeds? The best time to eat or drink chia seeds for weight loss is early morning on an empty stomach. Chia water also works well for weight loss, helping jumpstart your metabolism and keeping you full for most of the day. You can enjoy chia seeds as a pre-workout snack to boost your endurance and performance. Benefits of eating chia seeds Tiny but powerful, chia seeds have a lot to offer.

But let’s see what things we should remember before we enjoy the next chia seed treat: As chia seeds swell up to 12 times their weight, eating too many of them at the same time increases the chances of them getting stuck in the food pipe (Oesophageal blockage). Dry chia seeds can be difficult to swallow, especially for patients with dysphagia (a condition in which a person cannot swallow easily). Chia seeds might enter the windpipe (trachea) and result in choking of the airway. This demands prompt medical attention. Always eat chia seeds that are pre-soaked or mixed with moist foods. Eating too many chia seeds can cause digestive issues like bloating or constipation (because of high fibre content). Chia seeds can affect the activity of blood thinners and medications for diabetes and blood pressure. Although rare, people can be allergic to chia seeds and experience an upset stomach, redness, itching, swelling, etc. If you happen to experience any of the above or something unpleasant, do not hesitate to contact your doctor as soon as possible. Conclusion Chia seeds are so easy to work into your meals. No fancy ingredients needed. Sprinkle them on your yoghurt, stir some into a glass of shikanji , or make a delightful pudding (healthy, of course) with them. It’s simple, effortless, and certainly nutritious! Here’s an idea—why not try adding chia seeds to just one meal each day for a week? It’s a fun, easy way to see how easily you can add them to your routine. Before you know it, you’ll feel healthier.

But how exactly does the CICO diet for weight loss work? How to practice it in daily life? Read on to find out. In this article: Key takeaways What is a calorie deficit? - The science behind CICO Benefits of the CICO approach How to implement CICO? Addressing major CICO challenges Practical tips for success with CICO Beyond calories: A holistic approach Key takeaways The foundation of CICO is to eat less and move more. Your metabolism, hormones, genetics, and body type impact your weight loss efforts. All calories are not equal. Food quality plays a massive role in weight management. You can manage weight with stress management, adequate sleep, hydration, and physical activity. Consult healthcare professionals or dietitians to devise the best plan for you. So, you want to lose weight. You tried every diet in the world. You cut down on all your favourite foods. You left no stone unturned when it came to exercise for weight loss. But, all your efforts go down the drain - all the time. It is not your fault. You just did not know about CICO yet. The CICO diet for weight loss works. Research proves it. However, does it work for everyone? Or is this just another passing trend? This article reveals how the CICO concept for weight loss is the key to gaining a healthier, happier body that is not bogged down by excessive weight. What is a calorie deficit? - The science behind CICO When you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. Your body stores energy as fat. The opposite happens when you burn more calories than you consume. Your body uses stored fat for energy. This is called a calorie deficit. Energy balance equation Weight maintenance calories in = calories out Weight loss (calorie deficit) calories in < calories out Weight gain (calorie surplus) calories in > calories out Here's how your body spends its calories: Resting metabolic rate (RMR): These are the calories you burn to stay alive. Thermic effect of food (TEF): This is the energy you use to digest and absorb your food. Physical activity (PA): You burn these calories through workouts, exercises and other heavy activities. Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): This is the energy you use for day-to-day activities. This includes walking, cleaning, and more. Basically, you can consume fewer calories and lose weight. This is the CICO method for weight loss. Pair it with a diet of your choice, CICO works astonishingly well. This study [1] on the affordability of various healthy diets provides insights into achieving a caloric deficit (core to CICO) affordably and nutriously. Ultimately, the study concedes that CICO is an effective weight loss method. Benefits of the CICO approach The CICO approach for weight loss has quite a lot of benefits. Simple: It’s easy to follow—just consume fewer calories than you burn. Scalable: You can still enjoy your favourite foods as long as you maintain a calorie deficit. Mindful: It helps you become aware of your calorie consumption and develop mindful eating habits. Precise: It provides exact data to track and adjust your diet as needed. How to implement CICO? You know what CICO stands for and what it does to your body. But, how do you include the CICO diet for weight loss in your daily routine? Try the following easy steps: Calculating daily caloric needs To calculate how many calories your body needs in a day, follow these steps: Determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR): This is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. Use this calculator to calculate your BMR quickly and easily. Understand your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE): This gives you an idea of the calories you burn with exercise and daily activities. Calculate it here. Achieve calorie deficit: Aim for any of these calorie deficits: Daily calorie deficit Weekly fat loss (approx.) 250 Up to 0.11 kg 500 Up to 0.23 kg 1000 Up to 0.45 kg Tracking calorie intake and expenditure So, you determined just how many calories your body needs to function every single day? You also discovered that you consume more calories than your body needs to stay alive and thriving. Now, you want to burn those extra calories and eat fewer calories to achieve a calorie deficit…. This sounds like rocket science, but it isn’t. Track your calories daily, and you will finally be in control of your weight. To track your calories without any hassles: Use CICO calculators: Calculate your BMR, TDEE, and daily calorie needs with CICO calculators. Track your intake: Record everything you eat and drink, manually or through apps. Log your activities: Record your exercise routines and daily activities to track burned calories accurately. Using apps and software for calorie tracking You can use fitness apps like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and Cronometer to track your food intake. Wearable fitness devices like Fitbit or Apple Watch can also provide real-time updates. Additionally, you can install meal-planning apps to gain nutritional information about different food items. You can also try out some Indian low-calorie recipes based on your personal calorie goals with these apps. Manual calorie tracking for weight loss Like tracking your calories the traditional way? Create a diet log book and record the calories you consume every day. The same goes for your physical activities. Use a calendar, pedometer, checklists, simple timers, and clocks to track your activities. For starters, try out our weekly diet log. Be careful about your food portions. You can weigh or measure your ingredients if required. Read your food labels. Look for misleading terms. For instance, natural, low-fat, sugar-free, zero-calorie, no added sugars, and gluten-free. Remember, these labels may not guarantee the product's nutritional value. Adjust your goals based on changes in your weight. If your weight stays the same for a while, don’t worry. Consult a specialist for further advice. Addressing major CICO challenges It certainly looks quite straightforward in principle. However, sticking to CICO has its fair share of challenges. Here are some strategies to overcome them: Dealing with hunger and cravings One of the biggest struggles with CICO is dealing with food noise when experiencing a calorie deficit. Follow these 5 simple steps to prevent food cravings: Choose satiating foods: Focus on vegetables, lean proteins, fruits, and fiber-rich grains. These foods help you feel fuller for longer. Stay hydrated: Could your hunger just be thirst? Thirst can mask itself as hunger. Drink plenty of water, especially before meals. Check out this hydration calculator to track your hydration. Treat yourself occasionally: Love certain foods? Enjoy your favourite snacks in moderation within your calorie targets. Control portions: Use smaller plates and bowls to manage portion sizes. Minimise distractions while eating. Find healthy outlets: When cravings strike, find healthy distractions. Maybe go for a walk? Or ride a bicycle? Fancy a small jog? Ensuring nutritional balance Experiment with different macro ratios. Find what works best for your energy levels, performance, and hunger management. What about dietary supplements, you ask? Remember, dietary supplements can sometimes be helpful. But it's always better to eat whole foods rather than processed foods. Overcoming weight loss plateaus If you hit a weight loss plateau, your body might try to conserve energy. To overcome this, follow these 4 actionable tips: Adjust a little: Adjust your calorie goals regularly. Switch it up: Switch your calorie intake once in a while. Keep moving: Boost your activity with more steps, cardio, or strength training. Refeed your body: Have a ‘refeed’ day to keep your digestive system active. Are you frustrated or tired of trying everything to lose weight but not succeeding? Aktive's science-led treatment plans can help you jumpstart your weight loss journey. Common CICO misconceptions CICO is one of the most common yet most misunderstood weight loss concepts at the moment. Some misconceptions about CICO can misguide people. These include: \"All calories are the same\" myth In its simplest form, calories provide energy. By that logic, any sweet dish can provide tons of energy, right? Wrong. The source of that calorie varies from food to food. Plus, there's the question of how your body processes and uses different macronutrients. In such instances, you can look at the glycemic index of the food item. It states a food's (calorie) value in greater detail. The higher the glycemic index of the food, the greater the spike in blood glucose and insulin levels once the food is in your bloodstream. This triggers more fat storage. Hence proved, not all calories work the same way inside the body. Quality of calories vs. quantity of calories The total calories matter in any food item. However, the quality of those calories [2] matters as well. Whole, unprocessed foods contain nutrients, fibre, and healthy fats. These keep you feeling fuller for longer. As a result, you do not overeat, and yes, you experience less food cravings. Conversely, processed foods contain high levels of refined carbohydrates, unhealthy fats, and added sugars. You will not experience the same satisfaction after eating processed foods. Even when the calorie count is similar! Unfortunately, you will end up overeating and, ultimately, hinder your weight loss journey. Not a straightforward journey Weight loss is not always straightforward [3] . When you have a heavier body, you burn more calories to maintain it. As you lose weight, your body needs fewer calories. This process is ‘metabolic adaptation'. This can sometimes slow your digestion. Don't let it discourage you—this might not last forever. Some studies show that the metabolism returns to normal after weight stabilises. However, it might linger for some people. Each person’s body reacts differently, and no one knows why. Remember, weight loss is a journey . Focus on the long-term benefits. Know that your efforts positively impact your health. If you feel stuck, consider consulting a healthcare professional. Practical tips for success with CICO Looking for easy ways to introduce or maintain a calorie deficit in your diet? Here are some practical tips that can help you keep up with CICO: Meal planning and preparation Do you want to ensure you’re consuming appropriate portions and calories? Follow these meal prep and planning tips: Weekly planning: Take time out each week to plan your meals and snacks to meet your daily calorie goals. Prep in advance: Prep ingredients and meals in advance so you have easy grab-and-go options. Portion control: Learn good portion control habits by weighing/measuring foods. Nutrient-dense foods: Opt for nutrient-dense, high-volume, low-calorie foods that fill your stomach quickly. Staying motivated and accountable We all know how it is with dietary approaches. One moment, this revolutionary dietary method inspires you to transform your life. The next moment, you are down and defeated, lacking motivation and deterred. You are not alone. We all struggle to keep up with long-term weight loss goals when we go at them solo. Do this to stay motivated and remain accountable for calorie consumption: Support system: Get your friends and family to follow the CICO approach with you. Join online communities: Join online communities for accountability and support. SMART goals: Break down your big goal. Opt for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound ( SMART ) goals. Visual reminders: Create a weight loss chart or a vision board. Remind yourself of why you started your weight loss journey. Variety is the spice of life: Introduce variety in your meals, workout routines, or calorie-tracking methods. Self-compassion: Avoid harsh self-criticism when you slip up. Acknowledge that perfection is unrealistic, and restart. Identify triggers: Understand what triggers emotional or mindless eating for you. Develop healthy strategies to deal with ‘food noise’. Celebrate small wins: Watch out for improved energy levels, better sleep, and increased strength. Celebrate them. Plan for vacations: Make plans to manage your calorie intake without spoiling the fun! One Reddit user shared how they noticed a significant difference in weight by following the CICO method for weight loss. 180 Days - Down 56 Pounds - How I Specifically Did It by u/KidTheCurry in CICO Beyond calories: A holistic approach In his podcast with Youtuber Raj Shamani, Dr. Pal reveals, “Managing stress through lifestyle changes such as maintaining a balanced diet, ensuring adequate sleep, and incorporating regular physical activity is crucial for both gut health and effective weight loss.\" Beyond following the CICO method for weight loss, you need to reduce stress.

Do not focus solely on calorie numbers. Do not neglect other aspects of healthy eating. Doing so can have the opposite effect in the long run. To get the best of both worlds, combine CICO's formula with holistic lifestyle changes. Ultimately, the goal is to take care of your mental, physical, and emotional health. This is more effective than just chasing a number on the scale at any cost.

        "In an Instagram post, expert nutritionist Ankita Wassan clarifies that dosa can be a delicious and nutritious addition to your weight loss journey when prepared with the right ingredients and consumed in moderation.",
        "She states, “When cooked on a non-stick surface with minimal oil, dosa can be relatively low in calories compared to other breakfast options. Opting for smaller-sized dosas or those made with whole grains like oats or millets can further reduce calorie content while increasing fiber intake.”",
        "You know you cannot stop after eating just one dosa—you have to have more! But for the weight-conscious, navigating temptation like this can be tricky.",

        "We know that a plain dosa contains 168 calories. Eating a dosa benefits your health in many ways, but only if done in moderation.",
        "But that doesn't mean that dosa is inherently “bad.”",
        "Dosas can certainly be weight-loss-friendly when you eat them smartly. Portion size matters. And so does what you pair it with.",
        "Add protein-rich sides like sambhar, vegetables, and chutneys. Choose batters made from different dals or millets to add fibre. And if you love dosa for dinners, just keep it light and balanced.",

        "What is healthier? Dosa or idli?",
        "Both dosa and idli are healthy foods. But when it comes to the carbohydrate content, the scales tilt more in favour of idli. A regular-sized idli contains fewer calories than a regular-sized dosa.",
        "Idlis are steamed and prepared with very little oil. This is especially beneficial for those trying to balance their blood sugar levels and lose weight.",
        "The problem is modern idlis have become more like fluffy rice cakes (thanks to too much rice), while dosas are often fried with excess oil or ghee, which increases the calorie content. So, if you're going low-carb or oil-free, go for idli. And if you need something more filling and crisp, a dosa with minimal oil can be healthy.",
        "Is dosa better than roti?",
        "Both dosa and roti are nutritious and serve different purposes. But roti is slightly better than dosa because it is lower in calories, has more protein and fibre, and has a medium glycemic index.",
        "Dosa, on the other hand, is a fermented dish, which makes it gut-friendly and easy to digest. It is also a good option for those with gluten sensitivity or intolerance. But it contains more calories and less fibre than roti.",
        "The trick is to enjoy them with adequate vegetables and protein sources to get their benefits.",
        "What is millet dosa, and how is it different?",
        "As the name suggests, millet dosas are a spin on the regular dosa where rice is replaced with a millet (kangani, bajra, ragi, jowar or kodo). As millets are whole grains, eating millet dosas ensures you get the following:",
        "How many dosas can I eat on a weight loss diet?",
        "If you are on a weight loss diet, you can eat 1-3 medium-sized, homemade dosas in a meal. They should be prepared in less oil and eaten with high-protein, low-calorie sides like bhurji, vegetable sambhar and mint chutney.",
        "Are instant dosa mixes healthy?",
        "Instant dosa mixes are definitely quick and convenient to prepare. But they may contain additives, preservatives, artificial flavours or excess sodium.",
        "Instead, you can buy fermented dosa batter from the local vendor or the convenience store and prepare them while saving time.",
        "Which dosa is best for diabetics or PCOS?",
        "When selecting a meal for someone with diabetes or PCOS, you need something that doesn't spike blood sugar levels, has adequate protein and healthy fats, and supports gut health.",
        "In such instances, dosas made from millets (e.g., foxtail millet or finger millet dosa), moong dal, and brown or red rice can provide sufficient fibre and essential nutrients.",
        "These dosas are low on the glycemic index, stabilise blood sugar levels and can keep you full. These factors help in losing weight and restoring hormonal balance.",
        "Is masala dosa unhealthy?",
        "The potato filling in masala dosa adds extra carbohydrates and calories, which can make it less healthy. The oil or ghee used to prepare it can increase the calorie count.",
        "Instead, you can use less oil and add more vegetables to the filling to make it healthier. That being said, you can enjoy it occasionally without feeling guilty about it. But do remember to get back on track.",
        "Can I eat dosa at night?",
        "Yes, you can! Just keep it light.",
        "If made the traditional way, with minimal oil and a generous veggie filling, eating a dosa at night won’t mess with your goals. One plain dosa has around 168 calories, which is manageable if you eat mindfully.",
        "That said, dosa is still a high-carb food. Eating too many carbs late at night may slow down your metabolism slightly, especially if you’re inactive or tend to sleep soon after.",
        "What is the best chutney I can eat with dosa for weight loss?",
        "Here are some healthy, low-calorie chutneys you can enjoy your dosas with:",
        "Is fermented dosa batter better than instant dosa batter?",
        "Yes, fermented dosa batter does have an edge, especially when it comes to gut health and nutrition. Fermentation makes dosa easier to digest and also increases the availability of vitamin B and minerals to the body.",
        "Instant batters or quick mixes might save time, but they often skip this natural process. That means you're missing out on those added benefits; in some cases, they can be heavier or less satisfying.",
        "But if you are in a rush, don't worry about eating an instant dosa occasionally.",

As it is light on the stomach, dosa seldom causes any bloating.

An expert’s opinion If dosas are slightly calorie-heavy, then does it make sense to eat them while trying to lose weight? In an Instagram post , expert nutritionist Ankita Wassan clarifies that dosa can be a delicious and nutritious addition to your weight loss journey when prepared with the right ingredients and consumed in moderation. She states, “When cooked on a non-stick surface with minimal oil, dosa can be relatively low in calories compared to other breakfast options. Opting for smaller-sized dosas or those made with whole grains like oats or millets can further reduce calorie content while increasing fiber intake.” How to make your dosa healthier (without compromising on taste)? You know you cannot stop after eating just one dosa—you have to have more! But for the weight-conscious, navigating temptation like this can be tricky. Let us help you out. Here’s how you can have a healthy dosa without missing out on the taste: How to make your dosa healthy? Use healthier ingredients Substitute rice dosa with millet dosa Use oats, brown rice or quinoa in the batter Add more moong dal or urad dal for protein Mix in grated spinach, beetroot, or carrot Try better cooking methods Use oil spray instead of pouring oil Prepare cast-iron tawa before adding batter Sauté masala instead of frying in too much oil Control your portions and mealtimes Try to limit yourself to 3 small or 2 medium dosas per meal Eat dosas in the morning or afternoon for higher metabolism If you plan to eat dosas at night, keep it light and skip heavy sides Eat slowly and mindfully in a calm environment Add some protein Add egg bhurji as a side or topping with dosas Try paneer or tofu bhurji if you are a vegetarian or vegan Pair with Greek yogurt for added protein Serve with soya chunks curry for plant protein 5 instant healthy dosa recipes you can try Running short of time but still want something yummy? Don’t forget to try out these deliciously healthy dosa recipes. They are fermentation-free and great for busy mornings (or those guilt-free dinners). 1. Oats + moong dal dosa Soak moong dal and oats for 2 hours. Then, blend the mixture into a nice smooth batter. Cook like regular dosa. 2. Ragi + buttermilk dosa Take some ragi flour and add buttermilk, jeera (cumin), and salt as per your taste. Let this mixture rest for 15-20 minutes.

Dosing on dosas the right way We know that a plain dosa contains 168 calories. Eating a dosa benefits your health in many ways, but only if done in moderation. But that doesn't mean that dosa is inherently “bad.” Dosas can certainly be weight-loss-friendly when you eat them smartly. Portion size matters. And so does what you pair it with. Add protein-rich sides like sambhar , vegetables, and chutneys. Choose batters made from different dals or millets to add fibre. And if you love dosa for dinners, just keep it light and balanced. At the end of the day, food is meant to nourish and satisfy, not stress you out. But eating healthy meals is one facet of weight loss. If you are someone who has tried all sorts of diets and workouts but finding it hard to lose those kilos, Aktive can help you stay on track. With a realistic, flexible and science-backed weight loss programme, we're here to help you lose weight in a way that works for you. FAQs What is healthier? Dosa or idli? Both dosa and idli are healthy foods. But when it comes to the carbohydrate content, the scales tilt more in favour of idli. A regular-sized idli contains fewer calories than a regular-sized dosa. Idlis are steamed and prepared with very little oil. This is especially beneficial for those trying to balance their blood sugar levels and lose weight. The problem is modern idlis have become more like fluffy rice cakes (thanks to too much rice), while dosas are often fried with excess oil or ghee, which increases the calorie content. So, if you're going low-carb or oil-free, go for idli. And if you need something more filling and crisp, a dosa with minimal oil can be healthy. Is dosa better than roti? Both dosa and roti are nutritious and serve different purposes. But roti is slightly better than dosa because it is lower in calories, has more protein and fibre, and has a medium glycemic index. Dosa, on the other hand, is a fermented dish, which makes it gut-friendly and easy to digest. It is also a good option for those with gluten sensitivity or intolerance. But it contains more calories and less fibre than roti. The trick is to enjoy them with adequate vegetables and protein sources to get their benefits. What is millet dosa, and how is it different? As the name suggests, millet dosas are a spin on the regular dosa where rice is replaced with a millet ( kangani, bajra, ragi, jowar or kodo ). As millets are whole grains, eating millet dosas ensures you get the following: Protein Fibre Minerals Antioxidants Better control of blood sugar levels Lower levels of bad cholesterol How many dosas can I eat on a weight loss diet? If you are on a weight loss diet, you can eat 1-3 medium-sized, homemade dosas in a meal. They should be prepared in less oil and eaten with high-protein, low-calorie sides like bhurji , vegetable sambhar and mint chutney. Are instant dosa mixes healthy? Instant dosa mixes are definitely quick and convenient to prepare. But they may contain additives, preservatives, artificial flavours or excess sodium. Instead, you can buy fermented dosa batter from the local vendor or the convenience store and prepare them while saving time. Which dosa is best for diabetics or PCOS? When selecting a meal for someone with diabetes or PCOS, you need something that doesn't spike blood sugar levels, has adequate protein and healthy fats, and supports gut health. In such instances, dosas made from millets (e.g., foxtail millet or finger millet dosa), moong dal , and brown or red rice can provide sufficient fibre and essential nutrients. These dosas are low on the glycemic index, stabilise blood sugar levels and can keep you full. These factors help in losing weight and restoring hormonal balance. Is masala dosa unhealthy? The potato filling in masala dosa adds extra carbohydrates and calories, which can make it less healthy. The oil or ghee used to prepare it can increase the calorie count. Instead, you can use less oil and add more vegetables to the filling to make it healthier. That being said, you can enjoy it occasionally without feeling guilty about it. But do remember to get back on track. Can I eat dosa at night? Yes, you can! Just keep it light. If made the traditional way, with minimal oil and a generous veggie filling, eating a dosa at night won’t mess with your goals. One plain dosa has around 168 calories, which is manageable if you eat mindfully. That said, dosa is still a high-carb food. Eating too many carbs late at night may slow down your metabolism slightly, especially if you’re inactive or tend to sleep soon after. What is the best chutney I can eat with dosa for weight loss? Here are some healthy, low-calorie chutneys you can enjoy your dosas with: Coriander chutney Tomato-onion-garlic chutney Mint chutney Garlic chutney Tamarind chutney Is fermented dosa batter better than instant dosa batter? Yes, fermented dosa batter does have an edge, especially when it comes to gut health and nutrition. Fermentation makes dosa easier to digest and also increases the availability of vitamin B and minerals to the body. Instant batters or quick mixes might save time, but they often skip this natural process. That means you're missing out on those added benefits; in some cases, they can be heavier or less satisfying. But if you are in a rush, don't worry about eating an instant dosa occasionally. View programme Do I qualify?

Minerals These include copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium, iron, calcium, etc. - Most enzymes cannot function without them. They are needed for the maintenance activities of the body. Vitamins A, B (some types), E, C, K, and folate Are good antioxidants. They also improve immune function, energy production, nerve health, and blood clotting. Antioxidants Fight free radicals (unstable atoms harmful to cells) and lower the risk of chronic diseases.

        "This is a possible scenario. If you aren't losing weight even after exercising regularly, you might be missing out on key aspects of weight loss, such as diet and rest. Eat right, eat well, and get enough rest to let exercise affect your weight. Your sabzis, dals, chapatis are all good sources of protein, fibre, and vitamins. Eat these foods to see better results.",
        "You might also have an underlying medical issue, such as thyroid, diabetes, or PCOS. Your medicines might also be making you gain weight as a side effect. You should contact your doctor in that case and figure out what exactly it is that is stopping you from gaining weight.",

Mixing different exercises every day can make it easier to stick to your fitness plan in the long run. When you mix cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises, you improve your endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance all at once. Combining different exercises can help you lose fat faster. It also reduces the risk of injury by spreading physical stress across various muscle groups and joints. How often should I do these exercises to see results? To see the results of your efforts, try to follow these workouts at least 3-5 times a week. The key is to stay consistent and gradually increase the intensity as you progress. As everyone's body is different, so it might take a few weeks to start noticing changes. Pairing your workouts with a healthy diet will help you see results faster. How can I lose belly fat in a week? It is not possible to lose belly fat in a week. To dissolve accumulated fat, long-term consistency is key. Exercising at least thrice a week without fail and taking weight loss treatment plans such as Aktive will help you reduce belly fat at home in a healthier way. How to reduce belly fat without exercise? Unfortunately, you cannot reduce belly fat without exercise. Unless you follow the CICO method, or the ‘Calories in, Calories out' method, your body will not use the accumulated fat in as energy to survive, and so, there will be no fat loss. You will have to follow a proper exercise routine and eat right to reduce belly fat. Can I lose belly fat by doing only yoga? Yoga is great for flexibility, stress relief, and mindfulness. However, on its own, it may not be enough to lose belly fat. You can combine yoga with cardio and strength training to experience the benefits of improved strength and flexibility. These activities burn more calories and help you shed overall body fat, including belly fat. Is it necessary to go to a gym for these exercises? No, you don't need to exercise in a gym to reduce belly fat. Most of these can be done at home with little or no equipment. A lot of bodyweight workouts, yoga, and basic cardio can be done from the comfort of your home. If you like using weights or machines, sure, a gym offers more options, but it's not mandatory to be there. How long will it take to see results from these exercises? The golden word here is patience. It depends on when you start working out, how balanced your diet is, and how consistent you are. Generally, you might start noticing a reduction in belly fat in 4-6 weeks. Focus on inch loss, don't obsess over the numbers on the scale, and you'll be good to go. Can I do these exercises if I have back pain? Yes, but be careful. If you have back pain, always pick the low-impact versions of standard workouts to avoid strain. It's also wise to consult a doctor or physical therapist for personalised advice. What if I exercise too much? Overexercising has its pitfalls. In a bid to lose belly fat faster, you might exert too much pressure on your body with too many exercises. But doing so can cause Rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle tissue breaks down and releases kidney-damaging protein due to overexertion. It is always advisable to exercise only as much as your body allows you to. Listen to your body and know when to stop. Fat loss will happen if you are gradual and committed. What should I do if I do not lose weight even after exercising consistently? This is a possible scenario. If you aren't losing weight even after exercising regularly, you might be missing out on key aspects of weight loss, such as diet and rest. Eat right, eat well, and get enough rest to let exercise affect your weight. Your sabzis, dals, chapatis are all good sources of protein, fibre, and vitamins. Eat these foods to see better results. You might also have an underlying medical issue, such as thyroid, diabetes, or PCOS. Your medicines might also be making you gain weight as a side effect. You should contact your doctor in that case and figure out what exactly it is that is stopping you from gaining weight. View programme Do I qualify?

        "How does Aktive guarantee my security and privacy?",
        "Aktive uses up-to-date technology to keep your information entirely confidential. We guarantee to keep your data safe from third parties unless you provide consent. Your medical information will only be viewed by the partner doctor reviewing your consultation.",

        "What is BMI?",
        "Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using your height and weight. It tells you whether you're underweight, a healthy weight, or overweight based on your height, age, and gender.",
        "Why do you need a body image?",
        "A body image is required to ensure that you are eligible and so that we can see your progress. We will only ask for you to provide this once every 3 months. The picture will only be visible to you and our partner doctor - no one else will have access to it. We realise it's inconvenient, but it's essential for the safety of our patients and to protect those who are vulnerable.",
        "Do I know immediately if I qualify for treatment?",
        "After finishing the consultation, you will receive a call from an allied healthcare professional to confirm your details. During our working hours, one of our partner doctors will review your answers within 1-2 hours. Outside working hours, you can expect to hear back from us on the following working day. If we have any further questions or are unable to prescribe to you, we will send through a message.",
        "Why wasn’t my subscription approved?",
        "If your subscription isn't approved by one of our partner doctors, this means that the treatment isn't safe for you. It is our number one priority to keep you from any potential health risks.",
        "What happens if my subscription is not approved?",
        "If you're not approved for treatment, we will not take any form of payment. Your subscription will be cancelled and any pending transactions will bounce back into your account. There will be no hidden charges.",
        "Do I have to consult my local doctor?",
        "When starting a new treatment, it's best to inform your local doctor about the changes to your medical situation. This way they can also keep track of your medical history.",
        "What does the weight loss plan include?",

If they have any questions they will contact you via text message. If they deem you suitable, you will receive your treatment in 3-4 days. From then on, you will automatically receive a new supply every 4 weeks. We will always inform you about upcoming shipments.",
        "Which dosage will I receive and why?",
        "When starting treatment, you will begin on the lowest dosage. This helps to minimise any initial side effects as your body gets used to taking the new medication. As the weeks go by, your body becomes adjusted to the medication and you can increase your dosage slowly.",
        "What is the delivery frequency?",
        "For the tablet plan, you will receive one order of 30 tablets every month. For the injection plan, you will receive one order of 1 injection pen and 4 disposable needles every month.",
        "Can I contact the doctors?",
        "Yes, you can directly contact our partner doctors via email, text message or the message centre in your account. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Service Team, who will pass on your message.",
        "How does the dosage increase work?",
        "After 4 weeks of taking the same dose, your body will have adjusted enough for you to increase it. Taking a higher dose means more medicine, and therefore more weight loss progress. You may experience mild side effects every time you increase your dose - this is entirely normal and will subside once your body gets used to the new dosage. If you want to stay on the same dose, this is also possible. Just get in touch.",
        "Do I have to update my medical answers or body image?",
        "It is important to update your medical answers so that our partner doctors can see how you are responding to your treatment plan. New body images will also need to be uploaded on occasion to help track your progress.",

        "How does it work?",
        "Our treatments, available as both tablets and injection, work in five simple ways:",
        "Why is it more effective than other weight loss medications?",
        "Our treatments work on many levels. The active ingredient works by making your body produce more of a specific hormone that affects how hungry you feel.",
        "This slows down digestion and stomach emptying. It affects your appetite because your brain gets the signal \"I'm full' much quicker. Which means you eat less.",
        "The medication also resets your metabolism. You have a set point that your body defends to maintain. It gives you hunger signals if you drop below this point. The hormones reset this point to a lower level.",
        "Our treatments are clinically proven to help you lose weight. They are prescribed with utmost discretion and caution by renowned doctors and specialists - this is something that cannot be said of other weight loss medications.",
        "What are the benefits?",
        "The main benefit of our treatment is that it's proven to effectively cause weight loss.",
        "When combined with a healthy lifestyle:",
        "Losing weight also reduces your risk of developing severe health complications later in life, such as heart disease, high cholesterol and strokes.",
        "How much weight can I lose on your weight loss plan?",
        "How much weight you can lose depends on the individual and is also dependent on factors such as diet and exercise.",
        "However, on average:",
        "How is it guaranteed that the medicines are original?",
        "All our treatments are dispensed by accredited partner pharmacies.",
        "Who can use it?",
        "We can only provide the treatments to individuals with a BMI of 30 and above (or 27 and above with weight-related health conditions). If you meet that criteria, fill out our online medical quiz. One of our partner doctors will then check your medical history and determine if you're suitable.",
        "When do I start seeing results?",
        "Everybody's weight loss journey looks slightly different. However, you will likely start seeing results as soon as one month into treatment. Remember, healthy weight loss takes time and patience.",
        "Do I need to go on a diet?",
        "Yes. For the drug to work, you must make the necessary lifestyle changes to your diet and exercise habits. You should consume fewer calories daily, and make changes to your exercise regime. Most people should exercise 75 - 150 minutes weekly - this could be as simple as walking or doing household chores.",
        "What is the daily tablet?",
        "The daily tablet is a new generation weight loss medication that is taken orally once a day. No need to inject yourself.",
        "How do I take the tablet?",
        "The tablet is taken every morning on an empty stomach. Remember to take it first thing and wait 30 minutes before your first meal or drink of the day.",
        "What dosages are available?",
        "The daily tablet is available in 3 different doses: 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg.",
        "How do I increase dosages?",

        "What if I miss a dose?",
        "If you miss a dose, skip your tablet for that day and wait until the following morning to take another one.",
        "What if I experience side effects?",
        "It's very common to experience mild side effects, especially when you first start treatment and increase your dose. These can be managed with diet - for example, fatty and sugary foods are more likely to cause nausea.",
        "What is the weekly injection?",
        "The injection we prescribe is a prescription-only, once-weekly injection that is used for weight management.",
        "It removes excess sugar from the blood and slows digestion, which makes you feel fuller for longer and lose weight.",
        "How does the injection work for weight loss?",
        "The active ingredient in the injection works in five simple ways:",

        "Can I change my dosage?",

        "How do I store the injection?",
        "What are the benefits of taking the injection?",
        "The main benefit is that it's proven to effectively cause weight loss. When combined with a healthy lifestyle, individuals using our treatments can lose up to 21% of their original body weight.",
        "What are the possible side effects?",
        "Like all prescription medicines, our injection too can cause some side effects. This is especially true during the first few months. However, the most common side effects are mild and go away on their own.",
        "Common side effects include:",
        "Most of these side effects should disappear once your body has gotten used to the medication. However, if you experience any persistent or worrying side effects, speak to us or your healthcare provider.",

        "Make sure you eat your protein with fibre-rich vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, just like we have done in the meal plan.",
        "How to hit 75g of protein a day?",
        "To ensure you can get 75 grams of protein daily, try adding different protein-rich foods to different meals.",

        "What are the different types of protein diets?",
        "A variety of diets incorporate protein in different ways:",
        "Can I eat all my daily protein in one go?",
        "Yes. You can eat all your daily protein in one meal. Your body will slowly digest it and utilise it over time.",
        "That said, if you spread your protein intake across 2-4 meals, you have a better shot at building more muscle and recovering faster after workouts.",
        "Although the required daily protein intake is important, timing your proteins around physical activity can provide some benefits.",

        "Will eating this much protein damage my kidneys?",
        "For healthy individuals, consuming 1.5 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is considered safe. This range is well studied and does not harm your kidneys.",
        "If you already have kidney disease, diabetes, or any medical condition, check with your doctor before increasing your protein intake.",
        "Drink enough water throughout the day to keep your kidneys healthy.",
        "The problem usually comes only when someone eats extremely high protein (3 grams or more per kg) for long periods.",
        "The above-mentioned diet plan does not go anywhere near that range.",

We all need protein to lose weight. In this article: Key takeaways What is a high-protein diet? How much protein do you need to eat daily? How does a high-protein diet help in weight loss? Protein-rich foods in the Indian diet Your 7-day protein diet plan for weight loss Conclusion Key takeaways Almost 80% of Indians are protein-deficient. For weight loss, the ideal protein intake should be 1.2–2.0g per kg of body weight. Simple Indian staples such as dal, chana, paneer, eggs, and chicken can fulfil your protein needs. A high-protein diet keeps you full, reduces cravings, and helps with weight loss without muscle loss. Ready to kickstart a 7-day high-protein diet plan for weight loss without compromising on muscle mass? With this guide, you’ll discover the following: How to consume 45g-60g protein each day, across breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, and dinner. How to prepare protein-rich Indian recipes under 30 minutes, both veg and non-veg, so that your busy schedule doesn’t hamper your health. How to fulfil your protein needs with staple Indian kitchen ingredients - dal, paneer, chicken, eggs, and soya. How to lose fat, but not your muscle mass or strength - because weight loss does not mean health loss What is a high-protein diet? A study [1] suggests that a high-protein diet means consuming more protein than the usual dietary recommendation of 0.8g per kg of body weight, or 15–16% of total energy intake. How much protein do you need to eat daily? The amount of protein one needs to take for weight loss depends on many factors. Age Gender Activity level Body weight Muscle mass Source and quality of protein Pre-existing medical conditions. Dietary and cultural preferences For weight loss: Men need approximately 1.6–2.2g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. Women need approximately 1.5–2.0g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. For weight maintenance, the ICMR recommends consuming at least 0.8g to 1g of protein per kilogram of body weight daily. How does a high-protein diet help in weight loss? Protein is a crucial element in weight loss. According to a study [2] , this is how protein helps with weight loss: A protein-rich diet releases hormones such as GLP-1 and CCK, which help lower hunger levels. The hunger hormone ghrelin is not able to act at full capacity. So you feel fuller and snack less. The amino acids in protein signal the brain to eat less, which reduces your calorie intake. Your body needs more energy (calories) to digest protein, which means you burn more calories with a protein-rich diet. Together, all these processes contribute to the high-calorie burn after eating a protein-rich meal. More calories burned = Better weight loss.

Take charge, experiment, and share your stories with us. Looking for flexible, personalised diet plans that fit your hectic lifestyle and helps you lose upto 21% weight in 16 months? Join Aktive FAQs Is it safe to eat very high amounts of protein every day? While the 7-day plan gives you around 1.5 to 2.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight, problems can start when you eat too much protein and cut out other nutrients. Very high protein intake can lead to constipation, nausea, loose motions, or extra strain on your kidneys and liver. The idea is balance. Make sure you eat your protein with fibre-rich vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, just like we have done in the meal plan. How to hit 75g of protein a day? To ensure you can get 75 grams of protein daily, try adding different protein-rich foods to different meals. You can include lentils, beans, chickpeas, paneer , eggs, fish, low-fat dairy products (such as Greek yoghurt), quinoa, and more in your breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Just avoid eating protein in excess and neglecting other nutrients. Do I have to eat perfectly every day to lose weight? Not at all! Sustainable weight loss allows flexibility. However, you can try the 80-20 rule of weight loss. According to this principle, 80% of your meals must include healthy, nutrient-rich, unprocessed foods, while the remaining 20% can be reserved for treats you enjoy. The motive here is to get fit and eat healthy without staying deprived. This way, it will be easier for you to lose weight or maintain it in the long term. Can I follow this plan if I have diabetes or PCOS? Yes, a high-protein diet can surely help manage PCOS or diabetes , but it’s essential you consult your doctor or nutritionist to rule out any potential problems: For diabetes: Focus on low-GI carbs like quinoa and brown rice to pair with protein. For PCOS: High-protein diets can help regulate insulin levels and support weight management. Check out these 10 simple tips to lose weight with PCOS. Do I need protein supplements to follow this plan? No, not everyone needs protein supplements. You can fulfil your daily protein needs with whole foods like eggs, lentils, paneer , and chicken. However, a high-quality protein powder can be a good addition for athletes, bodybuilders, or those recovering from illness. What are the different types of protein diets? A variety of diets incorporate protein in different ways: High-protein, low-carb diet: These diets emphasise eating diets low in carbs and high in protein and fats as a way to lose weight (e.g., Atkins diet). Protein-calorie deficit diet: This involves eating high-protein diets while maintaining a calorie deficit for weight loss. Vegetarian protein diet: This diet is ideal for vegetarians or vegans as it depends on plant-based sources like lentils, tofu, and nuts. Balanced macronutrient diet: Here, protein, carbs, and fats are taken in balanced amounts. Can I eat all my daily protein in one go? Yes. You can eat all your daily protein in one meal. Your body will slowly digest it and utilise it over time. That said, if you spread your protein intake across 2-4 meals, you have a better shot at building more muscle and recovering faster after workouts. Although the required daily protein intake is important, timing your proteins around physical activity can provide some benefits. Can I meal prep all these recipes for the week? Yes, you can. Most recipes work very well for meal prep. Here is a quick guide to how long each one stays fresh in the fridge: Dal -based dishes like moong dal chilla , dal makhani , and palak dal soup: 3 to 4 days Paneer dishes: 2 to 3 days Grilled chicken: 3 to 4 days (or freeze for longer) Boiled eggs: 5 to 7 days Soya chunks preparation: 3 to 4 days Millets and quinoa: stays well for 4 to 5 days when cooked in batches Prep your protein components over the weekend, store them in airtight containers, and simply reheat and assemble during the week. It saves time and keeps you on track. Will eating this much protein damage my kidneys? For healthy individuals, consuming 1.5 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is considered safe. This range is well studied and does not harm your kidneys. If you already have kidney disease, diabetes, or any medical condition, check with your doctor before increasing your protein intake. Drink enough water throughout the day to keep your kidneys healthy. The problem usually comes only when someone eats extremely high protein (3 grams or more per kg) for long periods. The above-mentioned diet plan does not go anywhere near that range. What if I do not like paneer, eggs, or soya? That is completely fine. You can switch the main ingredient without significantly affecting protein intake. Replace paneer with tofu, grilled chicken, or extra dal . If you wish to avoid eggs, try paneer dishes, chickpea scramble, or soya. Instead of soya, you can use rajma , chickpeas, or mixed lentils instead. All these swaps give you similar protein in each serving, so your daily intake stays on track. View programme Do I qualify?

        "Let's understand our cravings, not fight them.",
        "Intense, specific, and hard to resist—these are the three things that define a food craving. It is a powerful urge to eat food even when you are not feeling hungry.",
        "When your brain sees or smells something tempting, it remembers how good it felt last time and activates your reward system by releasing dopamine (the ultimate pleasure-seeking hormone). This pushes you to eat that food again, even if you're full.",
        "Unlike true hunger, where the body needs food to nourish and energise itself, cravings are usually focused on particular foods that are sweet, salty, or high in fat.",
        "But why do we experience cravings? There are biological, environmental, and psychological factors at play.",

        "So, the more we decode these signals, the better we manage our health and weight.",

        "So when the body feels low, tired, or simply thirsty, you may find yourself heading to the coffee machine.",
        "When you crave relief, relaxation, or stimulation, these substances either calm you down or give you a dopamine high or a quick hit of pleasure.",
        "But they wear off fast, making your brain depend on them just to feel okay.",
        "More sugar means more dopamine for the brain. Also, the acidic taste of carbonated drinks leaves you feeling 'refreshed.'",
        "In reality, the high sugar content of these drinks draws more water from the body and leaves us thirsty.",
        "The best way to handle these cravings is to choose hydrating, mineral-rich, or mood-boosting drinks that nourish your body and not just your taste buds.",
        "Avoid these:",
        "Smart swaps:",
        "First and foremost, it's okay to have cravings. We are human, after all!",
        "But you can choose not to act on every craving you have. Acknowledging and understanding this is important.",
        "A Reddit user recommends keeping busy with different activities (plus some extra tips) so they can keep your mind off the next meal.",

Or gorged on vada pav just because “we felt like it?” “I shouldn't be eating this,” you say. But ate it anyway. After a few bites, the guilt starts to creep in. In this article: Key Takeaways: What are food cravings? Why do we have cravings? 5 different food cravings and what they mean How to stop food cravings? Can cravings be a sign of disease? Cravings are signals, not failures Key Takeaways: A craving is an intense urge to eat a particular food. Food cravings are often driven by hormonal imbalances, learned habits, emotional triggers, nutrient deficiencies or brain chemistry. Stress and lack of good sleep affect your hunger hormones. This leads to more frequent and intense cravings. Persistent cravings may also be the result of specific health issues and need medical attention. It is possible to rewire your cravings. You can break the loop by replacing the trigger with a healthier habit. Sounds familiar? Most of us have experienced cravings at some point. We are all guilty of some indulgent snacking. The problem arises when these cravings start affecting our weight. But what if we say these cravings aren't simply about a lack of willpower or discipline? In this guide, we'll decode the science behind food cravings, explain why some foods are impossible to resist, and check out some simple ways to reduce cravings minus the guilt. Let's understand our cravings, not fight them. What are food cravings? Intense, specific, and hard to resist —these are the three things that define a food craving. It is a powerful urge to eat food even when you are not feeling hungry. When your brain sees or smells something tempting, it remembers how good it felt last time and activates your reward system by releasing dopamine (the ultimate pleasure-seeking hormone). This pushes you to eat that food again, even if you're full. Unlike true hunger, where the body needs food to nourish and energise itself, cravings are usually focused on particular foods that are sweet, salty, or high in fat. But why do we experience cravings? There are biological, environmental, and psychological factors at play. Why do we have cravings? The common causes of cravings include: Hormonal imbalances that affect hunger and stress. Nutrient deficiency, such as lack of protein, fibre, magnesium, vitamin B-12, iron, and even water. Poor sleep affects hunger signals. Sensory triggers such as smell, taste, and texture. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, anaemia, etc. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. A dip in oestrogen and an increase in prolactin (breastfeeding hormone) during pregnancy. Fluctuations in testosterone levels. Stress, sadness, loneliness, or boredom leading to an increase in cortisol (a stress hormone) levels. Repeated eating patterns out of habit. Now you know that cravings aren't your enemy but your body's way of communicating with you. So, the more we decode these signals, the better we manage our health and weight. 5 different food cravings and what they mean It’s time to decode your food cravings! Let's see what they mean nutritionally and some smart swaps to help you manage them better. Sweet and chocolaty treats Starchy indulgence Fried or fatty foods Twisted tanginess (salty and sour foods) Bubbly (or not) beverages and substances 1. Sweet and chocolaty treats When you feel tired or simply PMSing, your body wants a quick burst of energy. And the front-runners are: Chocolate Sugary foods Why does it happen? Do you find yourself craving some chocolates, laddu , halwa , or that yummy cream biscuit? Chocolate is a decadent combination of sugar, fat (cocoa butter), special compounds (phenylethylamine, theobromine), and magnesium. On the other hand, sugary foods boost serotonin and dopamine, the hormones that make us feel good. Over time, this creates a loop: feel low → crave sweet → feel better (for a bit) → feel low → repeat. So, to beat these cravings, you need foods that are nutrient-dense (whole grains, proteins, fibre, healthy fats), keep you feeling full, and control your mood swings. Avoid these: Chocolate pastry or cake Chocolate milkshake Hot chocolate sundae Gulab Jamun Rabdi-jalebi Ras malai Ukadiche modak with ghee Kheer Smart swaps: Pumpkin or sunflower seeds Dark chocolate with 70% cocoa Nuts (almonds, cashews, etc.) Dalia (whole grain porridge) Fresh fruits (bananas, figs, dried apricots, etc.) Foods made using natural stevia Gud (jaggery), but in moderation Paneer bhurji , eggs, whole grain rotis Protein-rich dishes like moong dal , spinach paratha , and methi thepla 2. Starchy indulgence What happens when PMS, stress, or a gloomy winter day strikes? You need something soft and warm. And starchy foods like bread or toast are like carb-filled hugs, just the right amount of warmth, crisp, and fuzz. Why does it happen? Bread, specifically white or refined bread, causes an insulin spike. This insulin spike means tryptophan, an amino acid, stays in the bloodstream for longer. This tryptophan enters the brain and makes serotonin (the feel-good chemical). You feel calm and soothing after eating a slice of bread, at least temporarily. To manage these cravings better, you need a mix of complex carbs and protein to balance blood sugar and keep you full for long. Avoid these: Pav (used in pav bhaji or vada pav) Bakery buns or chai-toast Naan or kulcha Smart swaps: Ragi roti Jowar bhakri Whole wheat paratha Bajra roti Multigrain dosa 3. Fried or fatty foods Do you feel tempted to eat that crispy pakora , delicious cheeseburger or a cheesy wrap? Why does it happen? Fatty foods can be a source of comfort, especially when stress or boredom strikes. Besides carbs, the body also uses fats as an energy source. And energy activates the brain's reward system with more dopamine. Also, you may lack healthy fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Foods rich in healthy fats and fat-soluble nutrients can be effective in reducing your cravings. Avoid these: Samosas Pakoras (onion or potato fritters) Chicken dishes Smart swaps: Roasted or air-fried makhana Ragi chips, roasted chana, masala lotus seeds Nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios) or peanut chikki Roasted flaxseed Sweet potato wedges (oven-baked) with hummus or curd dip Coconut or groundnut chutney Grilled paneer tikka with mint chutney For vitamins (A, D, E, and K) - papaya, mango, sun-dried mushrooms, almonds, sunflower seeds, and leafy green vegetables. 4. Twisted tanginess (salty and sour foods) If salted french fries, pani puri , or tangy pickles are on your mind, your body might be asking for foods that are: Salty Sour Why does it happen? When you crave salt, your body needs to replenish its sodium or chloride levels. These are electrolytes and are responsible for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. If you get achaar ka vichar, this may be due to low vitamin C or a sluggish digestive system that needs acidity. To beat these cravings, you need swaps that restore electrolytes and provide gentle digestive support. Avoid these: Chaat ( pani puri, sev puri, dahi puri ) Salted chips and wafers Pickles (mango, lemon, chilli) Amla murabba (sweetened gooseberry preserve) Sour candies Sour golas (snow cones) Smart swaps: Rock salt in lemon water Fermented foods like idli and dosa Coconut water or chaas (buttermilk) with roasted jeera Amla juice, lemon juice in dals , or sabzis Tamarind-based chutneys (in moderation) Roasted chana , masala makhana, baked khakra 5. Bubbly (or not) beverages and substances Whether it's your dose of, tea and coffee, an evening drink (alcohol) or substances, or a tall glass of cola (fizzy drinks), sometimes, the craving is more about comfort or stimulation than keeping your thirst at bay. Why does it happen? Tea and coffee: Being good sources of caffeine, these beverages block adenosine (a sleep-promoting chemical) receptors in the brain and help you stay awake. So when the body feels low, tired, or simply thirsty, you may find yourself heading to the coffee machine. Alcoholic beverages and recreational substances: It's chemistry. And the winner is always dopamine (not you). When you crave relief, relaxation, or stimulation, these substances either calm you down or give you a dopamine high or a quick hit of pleasure. But they wear off fast, making your brain depend on them just to feel okay. Fizzy/sugary drinks: Craving a cola or sharbat? You probably need a quick dose of energy. More sugar means more dopamine for the brain. Also, the acidic taste of carbonated drinks leaves you feeling 'refreshed.' In reality, the high sugar content of these drinks draws more water from the body and leaves us thirsty. The best way to handle these cravings is to choose hydrating, mineral-rich, or mood-boosting drinks that nourish your body and not just your taste buds. Avoid these: Tea/Coffee: Masala chai , filter coffee, cold coffee, black coffee Alcohol/Substances: Beer, rum, vodka, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, recreational drugs Sugary drinks: Sharbat , cola, lemon soda, ginger ale, roohafza , sweet lassi Smart swaps: Tea and coffee: Coconut water Buttermilk with pink salt Decaf coffee Herbal teas ( tulsi , chamomile, etc.), Lemon water and plain water Alcoholic beverages and recreational substances: Coconut water Dark chocolate Exercise Ginseng tea Sunflower seeds Cool drinks or fizzy beverages: Nimbu pani Jaljeera Buttermilk (chaas) Aam panna Kokum sharbat How to stop food cravings? First and foremost, it's okay to have cravings. We are human, after all! But you can choose not to act on every craving you have. Acknowledging and understanding this is important. Include more protein, healthy fats, and fibre in every meal to keep your sugar levels steady and prevent unnecessary snacking. Eat nourishing foods every 3-4 hours. Skipping meals can increase food cravings. Consider meal portions. Drink a few sips of water to quench your cravings. Observe, understand, and replace your triggers for emotional eating. Stay away from tempting junk foods. Try to eat only healthy snacks like roasted chana , makhana , fruits and nuts. Feel free to indulge in your favourite high-calorie foods occasionally—but do so in moderation. Mix and match your habits. If you munch on popcorn while watching TV, try sipping herbal tea instead. A Reddit user recommends keeping busy with different activities (plus some extra tips) so they can keep your mind off the next meal. Can cravings be a sign of disease? It is okay to crave your favourite treat sometimes. It is normal and does not necessarily mean the presence of disease. But if those cravings are persistent, intense, and accompanied by other symptoms, these may be hidden signs of certain health conditions. Visiting a doctor may help you uncover these clues. Here is a list of some cravings and the conditions they represent: Type of craving/behaviour and what it may indicate Salty foods May indicate sodium deficiency, often seen in Addison’s disease or cystic fibrosis Sugar cravings May indicate low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) Sugar cravings + fatigue May indicate insulin resistance (where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin) Persistent, extreme hunger (Polyphagia) May indicate diabetes, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), or atypical depression (a type of depressive disorder) Ice, chalk, or mud (pica) May indicate iron deficiency/anaemia Fatty foods May indicate liver/gallbladder/bile issues Cravings are signals, not failures Cravings are only the tip of the iceberg. However, indulging in them also doesn't mean you have weak willpower. In reality, cravings are shaped by habit loops, hormones, emotions, or medical issues. With the right approach, they can be managed easily. Even research shows that reducing how often you eat craved foods can make those urges fade over time. Combining this strategy with balanced meals, better sleep, and mindfulness will help you achieve long-term weight loss. If you’re ready to turn that knowledge into action, Aktive’s expert-backed approach helps you build real, sustainable habits—without giving up on the foods you love.

        "Here, the ovaries end up having many tiny fluid-filled sacs (or cysts) form on their outer part. These sacs hold immature eggs (follicles).",

About 3.7%-22.5% of Indian women have PCOS. The health concern can make it hard for you to lose weight. If you have PCOS, you must be all too familiar with the struggle. But what if we told you, there’s a way to lose weight with PCOS . In this article: Key takeaways: Introduction What is PCOS? How to lose weight with PCOS? Conclusion Key takeaways: Practising mindfulness helps you recognise emotional triggers and avoid overeating, a key challenge for those with PCOS. Incorporating strength training and resistance exercises into your routine helps build muscle, burn calories, and improve insulin sensitivity. Adequate sleep and stress reduction are essential for managing PCOS, as they help balance hormones and support overall health. Introduction The scale is stuck. The stubborn fat won’t budge. It's frustrating! But weight loss with PCOS is possible! Women with PCOS are generally overweight or obese. But it's not your fault (more on that later). So, why is losing weight so important for women with PCOS? It's not just about fitting into your favourite jeans. Losing even 5-10% of your weight [1] can lead to: Reduced PCOS symptoms Improved insulin sensitivity Better hormonal balance Increased chances of fertility Lower risk of related health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes You don't need to aim for a big, dramatic transformation to see real benefits. In this blog, we'll explain PCOS and why it makes weight loss tricky. More importantly, we'll discuss how to lose weight with PCOS using simple, effective strategies. You’ve got this! What is PCOS? Let's break it down. PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects how a woman's ovaries function. It disrupts your body’s hormone balance, especially the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis, which is the control room of your period (menstrual cycle). Here, the ovaries end up having many tiny fluid-filled sacs (or cysts) form on their outer part. These sacs hold immature eggs (follicles). Now, normally, ovaries release an egg every month. But in PCOS, things change. You might have lots of estrogen but no egg to release. As many follicles don’t fully grow, they end up messing up the menstrual cycle. While more research is needed to understand the cause of PCOS, a major reason can be insulin resistance (the body’s inability to use insulin properly). When your body is unable to use insulin properly, it affects other hormones like oestrogen and androgens (male hormones) and worsens its symptoms. You might experience: Anovulation (non-release of the egg). Irregular or missed periods. Excess hair growth (hirsutism) Hair loss (yes, we understand the doglaapan/irony). Acne-ridden skin and oily skin. Velvety patches of thick, dark skin (acanthosis nigricans). Fertility issues. Difficulty losing weight. But why is it hard to lose weight with PCOS? A variety of factors come into play (read conspire) and make it hard to shed those kilos: Insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances (ghrelin and leptin) make fat storage easier and cravings harder to resist. Calorie restriction puts your body in survival mode, while gut health issues add another layer of difficulty. Mental health challenges like anxiety, stress, and depression affect your eating habits and motivation. Poor sleep can mess with hunger levels and slow down your metabolism. Slow progress often drains your motivation and fuels self-doubt. Juggling work, family, and conflicting dietary needs adds extra pressure. Repetitive meals can make it challenging to stay committed. Genetics can significantly influence body processes that affect weight gain. Now that we know the why, let’s get started with the how. And the tips begin! How to lose weight with PCOS? Tip 1: Focus on low glycemic index (GI) foods The Glycemic Index (GI) ranks carbohydrates based on how quickly they raise blood sugar. For PCOS patients, who often struggle with insulin resistance, choosing low-GI foods can make a big difference. Research [2] shows that low-GI diets, when eaten as a part of a 7-day PCOS diet plan, can significantly improve insulin sensitivity, lower testosterone, and reduce inflammation in PCOS. Eating low-GI foods keeps your energy levels steady throughout the day. This is a big plus for weight management and also cuts down the risk of PCOS-related complications. Leading gynaecologist Dr. Anjali Kumar recommends these easily available low-GI foods you can add to your PCOS diet plan to lose weight without hurting your taste buds: Low-GI Indian foods for PCOS diet Waters/Infusions Methi (Fenugreek) seeds water - Regulates blood sugar levels Curry leaves water - Provides antioxidants Moringa leaves water - Delivers essential nutrients Flours/Grains Besan (chickpea flour) - Adds to protein levels in the body Vegetable poha - Helps with easy digestion Legumes Moong dal - Provides adequate fibre and protein sprouts ( moong , kabuli chana ) - Helps the body absorb nutrients Vegetables Spinach - Fulfils the body’s iron needs Methi (fenugreek leaves) - Reduces inflammation Carrots - Adds to the body’s fibre content Capsicum - Fills the body with vitamins Fruits Apple - Helps deliver more fibre to the body Oranges - Delivers good vitamin C levels Grapes - Provides much-needed antioxidants Nuts Walnuts - Increases Omega 3 levels in the body Almonds - Improves hormonal balance Fox nuts ( makhana ) - Fills empty stomach without increasing calories Dairy Buttermilk - Delivers probiotics to the gut and cools down body heat Want to know how to incorporate these foods into your diet? Check out this comprehensive PCOS-friendly diet plan. Tip 2: Eat more protein While traditional Indian meals like rice and chapati are comforting, they are not too great in providing protein. But when you add more protein [3] to your diet, you're giving your body the tools it needs to regulate insulin, tame testosterone, and even deal with acne and unwanted hair growth. Try to consume 1g of protein per kilogram of your body weight daily. This will support weight loss, preserve muscle, and boost metabolism. Protein is excellent at controlling hunger hormones and keeps your hunger at bay. Easy ways to add more protein to your diet: Add foods like chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, lentils, chickpeas ( chana ), and tofu to your 7-day PCOS diet plan. If you are vegan, soy-based products and legumes ( masoor dal , moong dal, urad dal , rajma , etc.) are great options. Add some chia seeds to your breakfast. You can enjoy Greek yoghurt, nuts and dry fruits while snacking. You will surely enjoy these small, tasty changes. Tip 3: Practice mindful eating Mindfulness, with roots in Buddhist and Vedic traditions, has been a part of Indian culture for thousands of years. Rajayoga, Yoga Nidra, and Om meditation are a blend of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Mindfulness helps you tune in to your body’s natural signals and prevent overeating. Instead of eating out of habit or emotion (like stress, boredom, or sadness), it helps you recognise triggers that might tempt you to reach for food. Studies [4] even show that mindfulness can help change eating behaviours linked to obesity. This makes it a valuable weight-loss tool, especially for conditions like PCOS. Here are a few tips for mindful eating you can try: Think about what kind of emotions make you reach for food. There are better distractions than food. Try meditation, going for a walk, or calling a friend when emotions get the best of you. The next time you feel hungry, give yourself 10-15 minutes to decide what you want to eat. Keep more nutritious options in your line of sight so you’re not tempted by junk food. Don’t feel guilty if you slip up. You can always reset and move forward! Tip 4: Increase strength training and resistance exercises Strength training builds power and muscle with heavy weights and fewer reps, while resistance training improves endurance with more varied exercises. These exercises are truly becoming a game-changer for PCOS. Paired with a healthy PCOS diet plan to lose weight, they make it easier for women with PCOS to improve overall health. With strength training, you get: Improved insulin sensitivity. Lowered testosterone and other androgens. Reduced weight, unwanted hair, and acne. More lean muscle. Increased calorie burning, even at rest. Fat loss while maintaining muscle. Better physical and mental health. Increased self-confidence. Get started with these workouts at home, and let us know how you feel. PCOS-friendly exercises for weight loss Exercise Focus Area Squats Lower body Deadlifts Full body Push-Ups Upper body, Core Resistance Band Rows Upper body, Back Lunges Lower body, Core Shoulder Press Upper body Plank Core, Full body Here are a few tips before you get started: Aim for at least three sessions a week. Each workout should last 45-60 minutes and target all major muscle groups. Start with moderate intensity and increase gradually. If resistance training is not your cup of tea at the beginning, there is no need to worry. Try this yoga workout for PCOS . Tip 5: Time to de-stress! A little stress can be manageable, but too much isn’t good for anyone—and with PCOS, it feels like the body is constantly juggling emotions. Women with PCOS have higher levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) and are up to six times more likely to develop anxiety [5] compared to those without the condition. Cortisol also worsens symptoms like insulin resistance, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances. High levels of cortisol, amylase, and DHEA (a steroid hormone) show that women in this condition experience greater stress [6] . This could be from managing symptoms like weight gain, excess hair, and infertility. On top of that, there’s the mental strain from anxiety and depression. That's why engaging in activities that let you relax and practice self-compassion is essential to managing PCOS gently. Here are some techniques to lower your stress: Steal some time from your day and meditate for 5 minutes daily. You can use a meditation app, watch a YouTube video, or just close your eyes and focus on your breath. Do gentle stretches like lat stretch, child’s pose, low lunges, etc., for 10 minutes every day. If you are experiencing a stressful moment, take slow breaths for 3-5 minutes. Journal your thoughts and feelings daily in your diary, and let your emotions out. Devote at least 30 minutes to a physical activity like walking, dancing, cycling, or jogging. Spend 15 minutes in nature or just walk on fresh grass and unwind yourself. Remember, taking time out for yourself isn’t selfish. Tip 6: Sleep well When your sleep quality isn’t as good, it can cause the body to store more fat and worsen insulin levels. Women with PCOS don’t need the extra strain. Issues like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and trouble falling asleep share PCOS as a common factor. These problems affect the good restorative sleep you deserve and worsen hormonal imbalances. Even healthy women with a normal BMI can face this issue. It turns out that the “sleep on it” approach may be helpful in managing PCOS. Experts recommend sleeping for 7-9 hours to balance your insulin, cortisol, and hormones that control hunger and energy. Many doctors think that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) might be a helpful way to build better habits and sleep peacefully. Here are some tips for a sound sleep at night: Skip caffeine in the evening. Try not to drink alcohol before bed as it disrupts deep sleep. Exercise regularly. But if it’s before bedtime, keep it light. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation before you hit the bed. Make sure your bedroom is quiet, peaceful, and calm so you can sleep better. A consistent bedtime and wake-up schedule will train your brain to sleep on time. If you are a nap-lover, limit your daytime siestas to under 30 minutes. Turn off screens and avoid any blue-light exposure at least an hour before bed. Reserve your bedroom for sleep. Beds should be a no-working zone. Tip 7: Avoid sugary and processed foods We all know how tempting a bag of chips or a tub of ice cream can be. If you love binge eating, these ultra-processed treats can be hard to resist. They're designed to hit all the right spots in the brain with their salt, sweet, and fat content. But what you get in the end is insulin resistance. In fact, studies [7] show that about half of women with PCOS struggle with food addiction. Women with lean PCOS are no exception. This is why sugary foods top the PCOS food list to avoid. Also, birth control pills (often prescribed for PCOS treatment) can make cravings worse. If you notice your cravings increasing after taking these medicines, don't hesitate to talk to your doctor. There might be other options that work better for you. The good news is that changing your diet can make a big difference. By choosing fewer processed foods and more whole foods, you can tackle your cravings and symptoms. How can you reduce your sugar intake? Always look at food labels carefully for hidden sugars. Track your sugar intake daily. See what kinds of triggers tempt you into eating sugary foods. Skip sugary beverages and replace them with low-calorie drinks. Eat whole, unprocessed foods. Prefer eating homemade meals to avoid added sugars. Choose nuts, dry fruits, or fruit instead of junk food. Use honey or dates in limited quantities. Limit your dessert intake. Manage emotional eating with more constructive activities. Tip 8: Stay hydrated Who knew drinking water could help you lose weight? A study [8] was carried out among overweight and obese individuals, where they were asked to replace sugary drinks with water. This resulted in a small but noticeable reduction in weight and waist size. When you drink water (especially cold water), your body has to work more to warm it up. Now, this is an energy-intensive process. As a result, your body burns a few extra calories. Sometimes, thirst shows up as hunger and cravings. The next time you feel hungry, reach out for the water bottle before you grab that bag of chips. To help you ensure you are hydrated enough, corporate wellness coach Dr. Umesh Wadhavani has some useful tips up his sleeve: Set a reminder on your phone to drink water every 90 minutes. Drink 2-3 glasses of water before meals. Add pink salt, lemon wedges, fruits, chia seeds or cucumber slices for flavour if you dislike plain water. Try chaas, coconut water, protein shakes, or unsweetened tea as an alternative to water. Keep water within easy reach, and carry a bottle when possible. Tip 9: Try intermittent fasting (IF) If you are thinking about intermittent fasting (IF) to manage PCOS, it may be worth your time. IF is a method of eating where you create windows of eating and fasting and alternate between them. This way, your body uses stored fats instead of glucose and enters a “fat-burning mode.” The Jain community in India has been engaging in intermittent fasting since centuries. The aim when doing an upvasa is to increase self-control, detach yourself from unhealthy eating habits, and detox your body. Not just that, Ayurveda [9] often compares PCOS to Santarpanajanya Vikara (diseases due to excess). For this, Upvasa (fasting) can help balance and improve Agni (digestive fire). Intermittent fasting can improve insulin sensitivity, lower androgens (male hormones), and help lose weight. In one study , almost three-quarters of women with PCOS started getting their periods again after just 6 weeks of time-restricted eating (IF)! However, not all studies show clear benefits. A study [10] carried out on women with PCOS fasting during Ramadan didn't see any major changes in insulin or glucose levels. Still, the approach can work for some, especially when intermittent fasting is tailored to their needs. Ready to try IF? Here are some things to keep in mind before you embark on that route: Check with your doctor first before starting a new PCOS diet to lose weight. Find a fasting schedule that suits you. Start with shorter fasting windows before progressing to longer ones. See how your body responds to IF and tweak as you go. Stay hydrated with water or healthy, low-calorie drinks. Include more protein, healthy fats, and fibre in your meals. Don’t over-cut calorie consumption; your body needs fuel. Tip 10: Track your progress Track your weight loss progress and note changes in energy, mood, or eating patterns. This way, you can adjust your weight loss goals accordingly. Here are some simple ways in which you can track your progress: Maintain a food and exercise journal and keep it in a handy, accessible place. Try using a fitness-tracking app or device to stay updated about your progress. Measure yourself regularly. Not just the numbers on the weighing scale, but also measure your ‘inch-loss’ in shoulders, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, and calves. Fitness is more than numbers. Ask, \"Do I feel stronger? Is my skin clearer? Are my periods regular?\" These changes are just as significant as weight loss. Consistency is what makes the results of your efforts sweeter. Small, steady actions are all you need to create lasting changes in your health. Conclusion Living with PCOS is like going on a rollercoaster ride you never signed up for. The good thing is that it can be managed with the right strategies, and it is absolutely possible to lose weight and get fit. Many specialists on the subject are emphasising more and more on treating PCOS using a mix of healthy eating, physical activity, and certain kinds of cognitive therapies.

This step-by-step guide will walk you through everything you need to know: How to prepare your dose? How to choose the right injection site? Where not to inject Mounjaro? How to store and dispose of Mounjaro? What is Mounjaro? Mounjaro has tirzepatide as its main ingredient. The compound acts similarly to GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) hormones in the body. These hormones work together to control your blood sugar levels and appetite. Mounjaro is a once-weekly injection that helps overweight and obese patients lose weight. Launched in India in March 2025 Mounjaro is available in India in a pre-filled injection pen (KwikPen) with pre-set doses. It can be self-injected or taken with the help of a healthcare professional. It may initially seem complex, but it will be easier once you understand the steps. And that's exactly what we'll walk you through next. What is the Mounjaro injection pen? The Mounjaro injection pen is designed to deliver a set dose of tirzepatide. It is also known as the Mounjaro KwikPen. It is pre-filled, disposable pen that is used to inject the medication under the skin (subcutaneous). You can easily use it on your own or have a caregiver use it to inject the medication. This pen is used once a week. Here is a picture of a standard Mounjaro injection pen, so you can easily identify the parts: Parts of the Mounjaro KwikPen: Pen cap: It protects the pen when not in use. It must be removed before preparing the injection. Dose window: It shows the dose number (1 = full dose, 0 = dose delivered). It shows the dose and helps you check if the injection is complete. Dose knob: It is used to dial the dose and push the medication out. It should be turned until the correct symbol (like 1 or 0) is seen. Cartridge holder: It holds the medication cartridge inside the pen. Needle You must attach a new needle before each injection. It consists of: Outer needle shield (removed after attachment and is reused for disposal). Inner needle shield (removed and discarded before injection). Red inner seal. It is located under the pen cap. Extended line / Prime position: It appears in the dose window during priming to help remove air from the pen. How to prepare for the injection? Things you must do before injecting yourself Here is a quick checklist for you so everything is in place before you inject yourself: Place the pen on a flat surface and remove the cap in a straight direction. Wash your hands properly with water and soap. This lowers the chances of any infection. Make sure the label on the pen mentions the right medicine and dose. Double-check the expiry date. The solution in the pen should be clear to slightly yellow in colour. Before you proceed with the injection, you must get a sharps disposal container to safely discard the used injection pen, needle, and alcohol/cotton swabs. Please note: If the medicine looks cloudy, frozen, or has particles, discard the solution and use a new injection pen.

Replace the needle and do steps 6–8 once again. If it still doesn’t work, contact our customer support team. Choosing your injection site Step 9: Choose a spot with enough soft tissue for the injection. Mounjaro is injected in the subcutaneous (fatty) tissue. The best sites for this injection are: In the front part of the thighs (upper legs). Abdomen (the stomach region, but not too close to the belly button). In this case, keep a distance of 5cm (2 inches) from the navel. Back of the upper arms (if someone can assist with the injection). Important: Clean your skin with an alcohol swab and let it dry. Always remember to change the injection site. You can choose the same area, but inject at a different spot. If you also use insulin, don’t inject Mounjaro at the same site. Injecting with the KwikPen Step 10: Turn the dose knob until it stops. You’ll see a “1” in the dose window. It equals a 0.6 mL dose. This confirms that the pen is ready to deliver the full dose. Step 11: Insert the needle into your skin. Push the dose knob all the way in and hold it. Count slowly to 5 while keeping the knob pressed. Make sure the “0” appears in the dose window before you remove the needle. Step 12: Pull the needle out of your skin. It’s okay to see a small medicine drop at the tip. It won’t affect your dose. Now check if the “0” is showing in the window. If yes, your dose is complete. If not, reinsert the needle and press the knob again to finish the dose. Do not redial the dose. If you are still unsure if the dose was complete, don’t inject again. Reach out to our customer support team for help. After the injection Step 13: A small amount of blood is often seen at the point of needle entry. This is normal. If this happens, do this: Gently press the area with a clean cotton swab. Try not to rub the spot. Step 14: Place the outer needle shield you kept aside earlier back onto the needle. Step 15: Unscrew the capped needle. Put it in a sharps disposal container (more on that later). Never store your pen with the needle attached. This can cause leaks or clogs, or let air inside. (Storage instructions are mentioned later). Step 16: Put the pen cap back on. Always store your pen with the cap attached. How to take Mounjaro: A video guide You can also watch this video to understand how to self-administer Mounjaro for weight loss. Having trouble with your Mounjaro pen? Try this: In case the pen cap is stuck: Gently twist it back and forth, and then pull it straight off. If the dose knob is hard to press: Try pressing it more slowly. If that doesn’t help, your needle might be blocked. Replace it with a new one and prime the pen again. If anything has spilled inside the pen (like food, dust, or liquid), don't use it. Dispose of it safely and use a new pen. What to do after injecting yourself? Sometimes the injection area may appear bruised with mild redness or a bump. This usually fades away in a few hours or a couple of days. If you feel any pain, cold compresses, ice-packs, or over-the-counter medications (antihistamine creams and painkiller tablets) can help relieve soreness in the area. When to seek help? Sometimes, the bruising may not subside and show signs like swelling, pus, oozing, or a spreading rash. These might be accompanied by fever. If this happens, contact your doctor at the earliest. It could be an infection or an allergic reaction. Where not to inject Mounjaro? Now that we understand how and where to inject Mounjaro, it is equally important to know which sites to avoid. This helps us avoid causing any further harm to the skin or delicate structures in that area. Skin that is scaly, bruised, swollen, inflamed, burned, or hardened. Skin that is injured because of a previous injection. Areas where varicose veins are prominent. Lumpy or bony areas. Areas below the waistline. In the same injection site used for other medicines. Critical safety note Do not inject Mounjaro into your vein or muscle as it might harm your health. Contact your doctor immediately if such a scenario arises. How to store Mounjaro? Medicines like Mounjaro are sensitive to heat, light, moisture, and extreme temperatures. To ensure they have a better shelf life, you can follow these tips: Keep the unopened pen in the fridge anywhere between 2°C to 8°C. You can store Mounjaro at room temperature (below 30°C), but only for up to 21 days. Never freeze the pen. If it's frozen, avoid using it. Use the original box to store the injection pen to protect it from light. And of course, ensure your pen and needles are out of sight and reach of children and pets. Pro tip: Designate one drawer or shelf for storing Mounjaro. This way, you can always find it easily when needed. How to safely dispose of Mounjaro? When you are done with the injection, follow these steps to dispose of Mounjaro safely: Always remember, do not throw your used pen or needles in the household trash. Remove the needle after using the pen and place it immediately in a sharps disposal container. Do not reuse needles or store the pen with the needle attached. The KwikPen can be disposed of in the household trash or a sharps disposal container. The sharps container must be sturdy, leak-proof, and puncture-resistant. Label it properly to avoid any confusion. Once your sharps container is nearly full (up to 3/4th level), it's time to dispose of your sharps. Discard the KwikPen after 4 doses or 30 days from first use. Even if there’s medicine left. Avoid recycling used sharps disposal container. Different places may have different rules for disposing of used pens and needles. Check your local guidelines for how to do so safely. Ensuring a safe experience Whether this is your first injection or your tenth, you're doing this to take charge of your health, which deserves credit. Using the Mounjaro injection pen may seem daunting at first, but it becomes easier with practice. The important things are to follow safe practices , maintain hygiene , and be receptive to your body if something feels off. If anything feels unclear, you can always contact our customer service team for guidance or demo. Need weight loss support? When it comes to weight loss, you're doing the tricky part already. Let Aktive help you make it easier with expert-backed tools and support. Aktive Weight Loss Programme FAQs Does Mounjaro injection hurt? You may feel a slight pinch or pressure while injecting Mounjaro. But that feeling lasts for a very short time and is manageable. What if I see air bubbles in the Mounjaro injection pen? It is okay if you see tiny air bubbles in the pen. They are normal and won’t affect your dose. During the priming step, hold the pen upright and tap it gently so the air bubbles move to the top or break. What happens if I accidentally freeze Mounjaro? If you accidentally freeze Mounjaro, discard it safely and use a new one. Do not use the injection pen with frozen solution in it. What if I miss a dose of Mounjaro? Sometimes life gets a bit busy, you might miss taking your Mounjaro injection. If it has been four days or less since your last missed dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if more than four days have passed, you can skip the dose and continue with your next scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose to ‘make up’ for the missed one. Do I need to pinch the skin before injecting Mounjaro? Usually, no. When using the Mounjaro injection pen, you don’t need to pinch the skin unless your doctor advises you to. The pen is designed to inject into the fat layer under the skin (not the muscle), especially when used on the thigh or abdomen. Can I inject Mounjaro right after taking it out of the fridge? Yes, you can inject Mounjaro straight from the refrigerator, as it remains safe and effective when stored between 2°C and 8°C. However, some people find injecting cold medication uncomfortable or slightly painful due to a stinging or burning sensation. To make this comfortable, let the Mounjaro pen sit at room temperature (up to 30°C) for about 20-30 minutes before injecting. But never heat the pen artificially (e.g., with a microwave or warm water), as this can damage the medication. What is the shelf life of Mounjaro? Unopened Mounjaro pens stored in the refrigerator (between 2°C and 8°C) can be used until the expiry date printed on the label. After opening, you can keep the pen at room temperature (up to 30°C). Discard it after 30 days or once you’ve used all four doses, whichever comes first. How do I know how much to draw from the Mounjaro pen? You do not need to worry about drawing the correct dose from the injection pen. Each Mounjaro pen comes with pre-set doses. Just turn the dose knob until you see the “1” icon, and inject the full dose as instructed. Can I inject Mounjaro into a muscle or a vein? No. Mounjaro is a subcutaneous injection. It can only be used in the fatty layer under the skin. Injecting it into a muscle or vein may harm your health. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately for further assistance. What are the signs of an injection site infection? Such reactions may happen when bacteria or other harmful microbes enter the skin at the injection site. It usually manifests as: Redness or warmth at the site. Pain and soreness that is persistent. Yellowish-green or cloudy fluid oozing from the site. Red streaks emerging from the site. Itching or rash. Fever. If you notice these signs, reach out to your doctor immediately. View programme Do I qualify?

What if I freeze the pen? It is not advisable to freeze the Wegovy pen. If this happens, avoid using it. The frozen medication is no longer safe or effective. It is best to dispose of it and use a new one. How do I know if I’ve taken the full dose? Once you have taken the full dose from your Wegovy pen, the dose counter should return to “0.” If it doesn’t return to “0”, ask your doctor for further advice. What if I see air bubbles? It is normal to find tiny air bubbles in the Wegovy pen. It is safe and does not have any harmful effects. So you need not worry about removing them. The pen is designed to deliver the full dose correctly. What if I accidentally inject into a muscle or vein? Wegovy is meant to be injected into the fatty layer just under the skin (subcutaneous tissue). Injecting it in a different tissue, like a muscle or vein, will change how your body absorbs the medication. Sometimes, this may show up as bruising, soreness, vomiting, or nerve pain. In other cases, there may be absolutely no symptoms at all. However, if you think you injected into the wrong area, contact your doctor as soon as possible. What are the signs of an infection at the injection site? Infection at the injection site happens when it gets contaminated by microorganisms. Here are some signs to watch out for: Redness Warmth Swelling Pus Rash If you feel it is painful, spreading, or if you have a fever, visit your doctor at the earliest. Do I need to pinch the skin before injecting? You do not need to pinch your skin before injecting. But if you’re injecting into a thinner area (like your upper arm), a gentle pinch will help you deliver the medication into the right layer. Can I inject cold medication? Yes, you can, but it can be uncomfortable for some people. In such a case, let the pen sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Don’t heat it in a microwave or with hot water.

        "In another 2006 study[2] in Delhi, nearly 2,000 school students were observed. Those who ate breakfast had significantly lower obesity rates than those who skipped breakfast - 14.6% versus 22.9%.",

        "Are these breakfast recipes suitable for diabetics?",

        "Can I replace wheat with other grains if I’m gluten-sensitive?",
        "Many Indian recipes use gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, millet (ragi, jowar, or bajra), or quinoa.",
        "These grains can be easily incorporated into dishes like idlis, dosas, rotis, and thalipeeth.",
        "Can I use these recipes if I am a vegetarian or vegan?",
        "Yes. All the healthy Indian breakfast recipes are vegetarian.",
        "If you are vegan, you can easily adapt them.",
        "You can swap paneer for tofu, use almond milk or soy milk instead of dairy milk.",
        "Instead of ghee, you can use coconut oil or vegetable oil, and use plant-based curd wherever required.",
        "Most dal, millet, and grain-based recipes are already vegan, and any small adjustments are easy to make.",
        "What should I drink with breakfast to support my weight loss efforts?",

        "Water, chaas, green tea, herbal teas, lemon water, infused water, and gond katira (a drink made from tragacanth gum) are known for their excellent hydrating properties.",
        "Drinking them before meals or at specific times can help with portion control and weight loss.",
        "Can I skip breakfast and still lose weight?",
        "Yes, some people find that intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast) works for them.",
        "However, eating a balanced breakfast can improve satiety, reduce cravings, and provide energy. Find what suits your lifestyle and body best.",
        "How many calories should my breakfast have for weight loss?",
        "For those planning to go on a weight loss regimen, a weight loss-friendly Indian breakfast would range from 300 to 400 calories.",
        "Your dietitian can help you plan your breakfast and other meals based on your activity levels and metabolism.",
        "How can I replace sugar in breakfast recipes?",
        "The best way to avoid sugar without missing out on the sweetness is to use natural sweeteners! Some of them include:",
        "However, be careful while adding them to your breakfast, as they are easy to overeat and high in calories.",
        "Which is better for weight loss, oats or poha?",
        "Oats are nutrient-rich and contain more protein (10-13g) and fibre (10-11g) per 100g.",
        "This makes them more filling and helps control hunger. Their low glycemic index makes it easier to stabilise blood sugar levels.",
        "Poha, on the other hand, is light and easy to digest, with 130-150 calories per 100g.",
        "However, it contains less protein (2.5-3g) and fibre (1.5-2g) and may leave you hungry sooner.",
        "So, opt for oats if you are looking for satiety, and poha if you want a quick, light meal. Discover more about the health benefits of eating poha.",
        "Should I skip carbs completely for breakfast?",
        "Carbs are not as bad as they sound.",
        "They are a quick source of energy, just what you need to start your day. Completely cutting carbs might cause fatigue, headaches, or constipation.",
        "In fact, it is recommended to combine complex carbs with protein and fibre-rich foods so you get steady energy and enough nutrition.",
        "Unless medically advised, eating wholesome carbs for breakfast is good for health.",
        "Can I drink tea or coffee with breakfast while trying to lose weight?",
        "Yes, you can.",
        "Tea and coffee are fine on a weight-loss plan, but try having them without sugar or full-fat milk.",
        "Tea and coffee have natural compounds that may have a positive effect on appetite control and fat burning. But these effects are quite small overall.",
        "If you are looking for healthier options, you can also try black coffee, green tea, or low-fat tea/coffee.",

When you eat a healthy breakfast first thing in the morning, this is what happens: You get up to 40–200 kcal of extra energy throughout the day. You naturally eat less at lunch and/or skip unhealthy snacks. A study [3] suggests that individuals who regularly eat a healthy breakfast are less likely to be obese or have high blood pressure. A fulfilling breakfast prevents energy dips caused by prolonged fasting. A nice breakfast keeps your body clock in sync. 8 healthy Indian breakfast recipes for weight loss Now that you know the benefits of eating a healthy breakfast, it’s time to fire up the stove and try these 8 healthy Indian breakfast recipes!

The best time to eat breakfast is typically within one to two hours of waking up. This is a good window to kick-start your metabolism and gather energy for the day ahead. However, this timing can be adjusted according to personal routines. What makes the Indian breakfast perfect for weight loss? Nothing blends taste and health better than Indian cuisine. The good news is that you no longer have to hunt for difficult-to-pronounce ingredients from that far-off supermarket. Here's how breakfast made from Indian staples can help you lose weight: Protein sources: Pulses, paneer , lentils ( dals ), soy chunks, ragi , eggs, fish, and chicken help muscles recover after a workout session. Fibre sources: Whole grains (such as barley and quinoa), pulses (like Bengal gram and soybeans), vegetables (like drumstick leaves and red carrots), and fruits (like guava and sapota) are anti-inflammatory, keep you fuller for longer, and reduce sugar spikes. Fat sources: Visible fats (easy to see and added to food) are present in oils, ghee , and vanaspati , whereas invisible fats are naturally found in pulses, milk, and cereals. They meet 10-15% of energy needs without adding calories. Spices and herbs sources: Holy basil ( tulsi ), coriander ( dhania ), mint ( pudina ), cinnamon ( dalchini ), cardamom ( elaichi ), turmeric ( haldi ), and ginger ( adrak ) are anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant - plus, a study [4] shows that they reduce BMI and body fat. How to make your Indian breakfast weight loss-friendly? With these tips, you can surely make your Indian breakfast just as healthy! Control your portions. Use smaller cups and plates for eating. Use techniques like grilling, steaming, or air-frying to save nutrients and reduce calories by using less oil. Opt for almond or low-fat milk instead of full-cream milk. Try adding whole grains like dalia, rajgira, or bajra to your meals. Does losing weight feel like an impossible task? Let Aktive help you Weight loss can be challenging.

Check eligibility FAQs Can I prepare these breakfast recipes in advance? Yes! In fact, meal prep can save you a lot of time and energy in the coming week. For example, you can make the batter for moong dal chilla , roast nuts, oats, or makhanas beforehand and store them in the freezer for a few days. Cutlets, paneer fillings, sprouts, and dry-roasted ingredients can be frozen as well. On rushed mornings, you can put together a sprouts salad, ragi porridge, or a quick chilla in under 10 minutes. Are these breakfast recipes suitable for diabetics? Most of these breakfast recipes can easily fit into a diabetic-friendly diet because they use whole grains, high-fibre ingredients, and good sources of protein. These help keep blood sugar steady instead of causing quick spikes. Moong dal chilla , oats upma , and ragi porridge are especially helpful because they have a lower glycemic index. If you have diabetes, it is advisable to consult with your doctor or dietitian and monitor portion sizes carefully. Can I replace wheat with other grains if I’m gluten-sensitive? Many Indian recipes use gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, millet ( ragi, jowar, or bajra ), or quinoa. These grains can be easily incorporated into dishes like idlis, dosas, rotis, and thalipeeth. Can I use these recipes if I am a vegetarian or vegan? Yes. All the healthy Indian breakfast recipes are vegetarian. If you are vegan, you can easily adapt them. You can swap paneer for tofu, use almond milk or soy milk instead of dairy milk. Instead of ghee , you can use coconut oil or vegetable oil, and use plant-based curd wherever required. Most dal , millet, and grain-based recipes are already vegan, and any small adjustments are easy to make. What should I drink with breakfast to support my weight loss efforts? You can make several refreshing, healthy, and low-calorie drinks at home. Water, chaas , green tea, herbal teas, lemon water, infused water, and gond katira (a drink made from tragacanth gum) are known for their excellent hydrating properties. Drinking them before meals or at specific times can help with portion control and weight loss. Can I skip breakfast and still lose weight? Yes, some people find that intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast) works for them. However, eating a balanced breakfast can improve satiety, reduce cravings, and provide energy. Find what suits your lifestyle and body best. How many calories should my breakfast have for weight loss? For those planning to go on a weight loss regimen, a weight loss-friendly Indian breakfast would range from 300 to 400 calories. Your dietitian can help you plan your breakfast and other meals based on your activity levels and metabolism. How can I replace sugar in breakfast recipes? The best way to avoid sugar without missing out on the sweetness is to use natural sweeteners! Some of them include: Honey Jaggery ( gud ) Dates Mashed bananas Maple syrup However, be careful while adding them to your breakfast, as they are easy to overeat and high in calories. Which is better for weight loss, oats or poha? Oats are nutrient-rich and contain more protein (10-13g) and fibre (10-11g) per 100g. This makes them more filling and helps control hunger. Their low glycemic index makes it easier to stabilise blood sugar levels. Poha , on the other hand, is light and easy to digest, with 130-150 calories per 100g. However, it contains less protein (2.5-3g) and fibre (1.5-2g) and may leave you hungry sooner. So, opt for oats if you are looking for satiety, and poha if you want a quick, light meal. Discover more about the health benefits of eating poha. Should I skip carbs completely for breakfast? Carbs are not as bad as they sound. They are a quick source of energy, just what you need to start your day. Completely cutting carbs might cause fatigue, headaches, or constipation. In fact, it is recommended to combine complex carbs with protein and fibre-rich foods so you get steady energy and enough nutrition. Unless medically advised, eating wholesome carbs for breakfast is good for health. Can I drink tea or coffee with breakfast while trying to lose weight? Yes, you can. Tea and coffee are fine on a weight-loss plan, but try having them without sugar or full-fat milk. Tea and coffee have natural compounds that may have a positive effect on appetite control and fat burning. But these effects are quite small overall. If you are looking for healthier options, you can also try black coffee, green tea, or low-fat tea/coffee. View programme Do I qualify?

For centuries, people across Asia have sworn by the power of green tea, and now science is catching up to what they've known all along. Grown in the lush tea gardens of Assam, Munnar, Dooars, and Terai regions, dried green tea leaves are harvested from the Camellia sinensis plant. From helping with weight management to potentially lowering the risk of heart disease, green tea has a wealth of benefits to offer. But what makes green tea so special? And how can it fit into our daily lives? What are the benefits of green tea? Green tea helps lose weight. But its benefits do not stop there. Here are some of the key benefits of green tea. Helps break down fat with catechins (like EGCG) and caffeine. Kickstarts metabolism [2] by burning more calories. Curbs hunger. Helps the body use glucose better. Reliable substitute for regular chai or black coffee. Gradually reduces body weight and BMI [3] . Prevents cell damage. Expert gastroenterologist Dr. Pal Manickam explains why green tea is favoured so much by health-conscious individuals: When we eat, our stomach releases something (during digestion) called free radicals. These little troublemakers can harm our cells through a process called oxidation. Now to tackle this problem, antioxidants neutralise these free radicals to keep our cells safe. And here's where green tea shines. It's packed with a powerful antioxidant called catechin. Like a sponge, catechin soaks up these harmful molecules and protects your cells from further damage. Dr. Palaniappan Manickam , Co-Founder, Dr Pal’s NEWME How to prepare green tea? Servings: 1 cup Ingredients: 1 green tea bag or 2 g (1 tsp) loose-leaf green tea 240 ml (1 cup) water Honey or lemon for flavour (optional) Instructions: Heat water to around 79°C and let it cool for 5 minutes. Place a tea bag in your teacup. Alternatively, add loose-leaf tea into a teapot or infuser. Pour the hot water over the tea bag or loose-leaf tea. Steep for 2-3 minutes, depending on your preferred strength. Remove the tea bag/strain loose-leaf tea/remove the infuser. Add honey or lemon, if desired. You can also try these fun variations of green tea to add a little zing to your routine: Cold brew: Steep one tea bag in 240 ml cold water for 4-6 hours. Pour over ice and sweeten as desired. Lemonade twist: Steep one tea bag in 120 ml hot water, mix in lemon juice and sweetener, then top with cold water and ice. Pro tip Don’t steep the tea for more than 3-4 minutes, to avoid any bitterness seeping in. For a lighter flavour, steep for just 2 minutes. Always remove the tea bag without squeezing it. Best time to have green tea: In the morning or before working out. 4. Buttermilk What is buttermilk? Light, nourishing, and soothing to the stomach. In India, when people say \"buttermilk,\" they're are talking about chaas . It's a cool drink made by mixing yoghurt with water and spices. It's super refreshing, especially during hot summers, and people love it for its ability to beat the heat. What are the benefits of buttermilk? Buttermilk helps with weight loss in a wide range of ways. Offers essential nutrients with just 98 calories per 240-245 ml. Curbs cravings with 8 gms protein (per 240-245 ml).

Indians, especially in north India, love to cool themselves down with a refreshing glass of gond katira . Gond katira , or Tragacanth gum, is a natural gum rich in dietary fibre. It is also a good laxative (something that keeps your bowels clean). It is also loaded with prebiotics and nutrients. It has cooling properties and forms a jelly-like texture when soaked in water. It’s often used in summer drinks like sharbat to help with hydration and cooling the body. Did you know?

Regular gond has warming properties and is commonly used in winter foods like laddoos and panjeeri for strength and energy. It is available in powder, gum, and capsule form. But how does it help with weight loss? What are the benefits of gond katira? Gond katira benefits the human body in a variety of ways. This is how gond katira helps lose weight.

After a workout: Rehydrates and supports muscle recovery. Before bed: Eases constipation. 6. Jeera, Ajwain, and Saunf water What is jeera-ajwain-saunf water? Perfect to jumpstart your morning or after heavy meals for easy digestion. Jeera water alone can benefit your body in more ways than one. But what happens when more kitchen spices join the party? Jeera , ajwain , and saunf form a trio that works as a digestion specialist. It eases bloating and gives your metabolism a healthy boost. In fact, a study [7] showed that participants taking jeera seeds lost an average of 1.1 kg over two months.

Be it to soothe that cold or ease that upset stomach, the world is recognising the wealth of benefits turmeric has to offer.

It's not an exotic import. It’s not a trendy infusion endorsed by Bollywood celebs, the elite, and the rich. Instead, it's a humble drink that has been a part of our heritage for centuries - jeera water (cumin water). This simple drink, made from just two ingredients, has become popular, and for good reason. In this article: Key takeaways Why is jeera water popular in Indian homes? What is jeera water? Nutritional profile of jeera (cumin seeds) Top jeera water benefits for overall health & weight loss Real life success stories How to make jeera water for weight loss at home?

Despite all its multi-faceted benefits, drinking too much jeera water may do more harm than good. Jeera water is not a miracle drink. It helps alleviate health issues, but it is not the final cure. Why is jeera water popular in Indian homes? In Old Delhi's busy lanes and Bengaluru's high-rises, every home has a recipe for jeera water. It was once only used as a desi nuskha by our dadis and nanis for upset stomachs and safe but sure weight loss. But now, this drink has become a healthy habit for many. A busy working mother in Mumbai starts her day with a glass of jeera water. In Punjab, a homemaker offers jeera water to her guests instead of unhealthy soft drinks. A tired man in Bengaluru comes home from work and quickly makes a glass of cool jeera water for a good refresh. Right now, jeera water is everywhere. No one is surprised as to why jeera water has become more and more popular every day. More and more Indians are becoming conscious about their health. They're saying no to sugary drinks and looking at tasty, healthy, and traditional alternatives. A study found that consuming jeera and lemon daily helped overweight people lose weight. This is why, in many Indian houses, people drink jeera water for weight loss. The study was conducted on 72 participants aged 18-50 years over 8 weeks. They were divided into three groups of 24 participants each. Group A participants were given a high dose of jeera (75 mg) + lime, twice a day. They lost 2.1 kg weight on average. Group B participants were given a low dose of jeera (25 mg) + lime, twice a day. They lost 1.2 kg weight on average. Group C participants were given a placebo, twice a day. They gained some weight and their BMI increased as well. It is important to note that participants from Group A also showed significant improvements in fasting blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, and cholesterol levels. Sonia Bakshi, Nutritionist & Founder of Dance to Fitness Studio shared the benefits of drinking jeera water in an interview with Vogue, \" Jeera accelerates body metabolism and promotes fat burning, making you look fitter. The detox water is primarily useful for getting rid of stubborn belly fat as the fat-burning property of jeera water speeds up with the aid of a regular exercise regime.\" Fancy superfoods and expensive health supplements stop many from embracing good health.

Jeera water, as the name suggests, is simply water (water) infused with jeera (cumin seeds). It reflects the Indian philosophy of finding extraordinary benefits in ordinary things. To make jeera water, we dry roast jeera until it releases its aroma and turns a shade darker. We then boil jeera in water, and let the water absorb its essence and nutrition. The final drink is a liquid with a distinct, earthy aroma and a slightly bitter, warm taste. Do not let the word 'bitter' stop you from appreciating jeera water. Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice to give it a tangy twist. Or add a pinch of kala namak (black salt) to make it taste like nimbu water. Of course, in many houses, the bland taste of jeera water doesn't affect its popularity. So, they soak jeera overnight, drain it in the morning, and drink the water for the best results.

Its subtle, nutty flavour and satisfying crunch (after roasting) can make you forget the allure of processed snacks. By the end of this guide, you’ll understand why makhana is the perfect addition to your fitness routine and some lip-smacking ways to enjoy it. What is makhana? With origins from the Euryale ferox Salisb. plant (a member of the water lily family), makhana is cultivated with meticulous effort and toil in the fertile wetlands of India, such as Assam, Bihar, Manipur, and West Bengal. Also known as gorgon nuts, makhana is called the “Black Diamond” due to its round shape and hard, black shell. It grows well in tropical and subtropical climates, between temperatures of 20°C-35°C. In Indian religious practices, makhana is often used in making prasad and even enjoyed as a snack during fasts due to its non-cereal nature. Through a special popping process, raw makhana seeds are transformed into light and white puffs, which carry higher nutrition [1] than just raw makhana seeds. Did you know that in Manipur, the seeds, leaf petioles, and young fruits of the makhana plant are eaten as salads or vegetables? That's how versatile it is. But its versatility goes beyond just being a delicious food. Makhanas aids in weight loss. In fact, almost every celebrity and fitness trainer in India will vouch for its ability to do so. But why and how does this nutritious tiny seed help you get rid of fat? What makes makhana so nutritious? Makhana is what you say, “chota packet, bada dhamaka.” Ayurvedic tradition believes these seeds can treat a wide variety of medical conditions ailments. This fat-free seed boasts a rich nutrient profile. So here’s a list of the important macros and micros [2] it has: Calories - 328 - 382 kcal Protein - Includes essential amino acids Fibre - Offers a mix of soluble and insoluble fibre Minerals - Comprises of potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, sodium, and zinc Antioxidants - Includes flavonoids and phenolics, such as kaempferol Vitamins - Contains vitamins A, C, and B Fun fact: Makhanas carry similar amounts of amino acid to that of a fish. So, if you can’t eat fish for protein, eat makhana , and you just be fine. But, how can vitamins, minerals, fibre, protein, et al can help you lose weight? The seed is actually more nutritious than you can ever imagine! How does makhana help you lose weight? Makhana is a snack that encourages weight loss. Here's how: For every 30g serving of makhana , you are only consuming a mere 98 to 115 calories! Compared to nuts (like almonds or cashews), makhanas are low in saturated fat but have more healthy fats. A serving of makhana can better control your appetite than most other snacks. This is due to the seeds’ healthy mix of soluble and insoluble fibre that benefits gut health. [3] Makhanas’ protein content [4] helps your body spends more energy to digest, absorb, and metabolise protein-rich foods, and with amino acids, the seeds tackle stress-related obesity. With a glycemic index as low as 37.05% [1] , makhanas help in releasing sugar more slowly into the bloodstream, which slows down sugar spikes, and keep you energetic. Hydroxybetulinic Acid (HBAC) in makhana increases insulin release, making it easier for your body to use glucose for energy. Low calories Minimal fat content Packed with fibre Better protein content Low glycemic index Increased HBAC activity Can makhana really help with weight loss? Researchers explore what is exactly inside the makhana and how it helps people lose weight. To understand this, two varieties of makhana— Superior Selection-1 (SS-1) and Swarna Vaidehi were studied [5] . What makes SS-1 stand out? It turns out that SS-1 is much better at controlling blood sugar and insulin resistance, both of which are related to weight gain. It also has higher magnesium levels, a mineral that causes weight loss. SS-1 also has a decent amount of protein and fibre to keep you away from unnecessary snacking. It has a lower amount of saturated fat than Swarna Vaidehi. What does Swarna Vaidehi do better? Swarna Vaidehi trumped SS-1 with its higher levels of amino acids, which burns fat to produce energy. Long story short, the SS-1 variety of makhana may actually offer a better shot at weight loss. Its healthy nutrient profile and the ability to control blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation are tools for helping you lose weight naturally. How much makhana should you eat? According to the FSSAI, the recommended daily intake of makhana is 20-30g of popped seeds or 3-5g of powder. What is the best time to eat makhana?

        "It's easy to wonder, “Am I doing this right?”",
        "We’re here to help you figure out just that.",
        "Like most medicines, Mounjaro works best when its dosage is increased gradually.",
        "But how much Mounjaro should you actually take?",
        "This guide walks you through the standard Mounjaro dosage chart along with some useful lifestyle tips that will help you adjust more comfortably to the medication.",
        "The only drug in its class, Mounjaro, is a dual-action drug that activates two hormones in the gut: GLP-1 and GIP. It is approved for weight loss treatment in India and is available as a once-weekly injection.",
        "When injected correctly, Mounjaro does the following:",
        "Because this mechanism affects multiple organs, the body often needs time to adapt to it.",
        "That’s why your doctor will get you started on the lowest Mounjaro dose and gradually increase the dosage over the next few weeks.",
        "This helps you adjust gently to the weight loss medicine with reduced side effects.",
        "Doctors prescribe Mounjaro at the lowest, safest dose, i.e., 2.5 mg. The doses are usually increased every four weeks.",
        "About your dosages:",
        "Here is a typical Mounjaro dosing schedule doctors usually follow.",
        "Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice:",
        "At your next checkup, talk to your doctor about how you're feeling on both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses. Your progress so far will help them decide if you should increase your dose further.",
        "Everyone’s weight loss journey is different — and so is your Mounjaro dose. Your doctor will start you on a small dose and slowly adjust it depending on how your body reacts.",
        "They’ll look at things like:",
        "There’s no rush. The goal is to find the dose that suits your body best, helps you lose weight safely, and keeps you feeling well throughout the journey.",
        "One of the best and most useful ways to understand how your body responds to changes, be it medication, diet, or exercise, is tracking.",
        "You can simply enter your daily glucose readings, weight, and any side effects experienced in a diary. If fitness apps work for you, give them a go!",
        "A written record of your response to dose changes can also help your doctor monitor your health.",
        "This way, you play a more proactive role in taking charge of your health and maximising your doctor appointments.",
        "When you cannot take your dose within four days of the scheduled injection, it is counted as a missed dose. However, there is no need to panic if this happens. Here’s what you can do:",
        "You can take one dose on any day shown in the ‘missed dose’ row. If it’s a day, skip the dose and wait for your next regular dosing day.",
        "To change the day of taking the medication, keep a gap of at least three full days, or 72 hours, between the two doses.",
        "Sometimes, the body needs more time to adjust to a particular dose of Mounjaro. Certain situations may warrant you to lower your dose or pause it altogether:",
        "Always keep your doctor in the loop. Even small updates can help them support you better.",
        "Also read: Side effects of Mounjaro and how to manage them",
        "Adapting to any new medication, especially one that affects your appetite and glucose metabolism, takes some time. But with these small changes, you can adapt to the new dose better:",
        "The Mounjaro dosage chart has been carefully designed while keeping your safety, comfort, and health goals as the top priority. Some people see results early, while others take a little longer.",
        "And that’s okay.",
        "You just need to be consistent and patient and work closely with your doctor to find the dose that works best for you.",
        "What is the best time of the day to take Mounjaro?",
        "The good thing about taking Mounjaro is that you don’t have to worry about taking it before or after meals. This doesn’t affect how well it works.",
        "The key is to choose a time that’s easiest and most convenient for you to remember. This helps you stay consistent with your doses and stick to your schedule. So to make things easier, take it on the same day and at the same time every week.",
        "What if I accidentally take the wrong dose?",
        "If you take a higher dose than prescribed, contact your doctor immediately. Mild overdose may cause nausea or vomiting, but a severe overdose requires urgent medical attention.",
        "Can I split my weekly dose into smaller doses?",
        "No. Mounjaro is designed and prescribed to be taken once a week only. Splitting the dose can reduce its effectiveness and increase the chances of side effects.",
        "Does the dose affect how fast I lose weight?",
        "Not always. Weight loss depends on how your body responds. Some people lose more weight on lower doses, especially when combined with lifestyle changes.",
        "Will increasing my dose reduce my hunger even more?",
        "Yes. Increasing the dose may increase the suppression of appetite. This is because GLP-1 and GIP activity is increased, which sends stronger ‘fullness signals’ to the brain.",
        "Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro?",
        "You can take alcohol while on Mounjaro, but only in moderation. Heavy drinking can aggravate the side effects and pose a risk to your overall health. Consult your doctor to know more.",
        "Can I inject Mounjaro at a different time each week?",
        "Ideally, it is preferable to take Mounjaro on the same day and time each week.",
        "But if you do need to change your injection day or time, maintain a gap of at least 72 hours from the previous dose.",
        "How do I know if the medication is working?",
        "Monitor your weight, appetite, and energy to understand if Mounjaro is actually working for you.",
        "If the medicine is working, you will experience less cravings, more energy, and eventually, weight loss. Your blood pressure and blood sugar levels will stabilise.",
        "How long should I stay on Mounjaro?",
        "The length of treatment with Mounjaro depends on your health goals. You may need to take this medication anywhere from six months to several years.",
        "For example, people with type 2 diabetes may need to take Mounjaro long-term to manage blood sugar levels.",
        "For weight loss and maintenance, your doctor will guide you on when and how to stop taking Moujaro gradually and safely.",
        "Can I stop Mounjaro for a month and restart where I left off?",
        "When it comes to any medication, especially Mounjaro, it’s best to consult your doctor before stopping or restarting it after a break.",
        "You may need to restart at a lower dose, like 2.5 mg, rather than resuming your previous dose. This is because your body’s tolerance to the medication may decrease during the break. Jumping back to a higher dose could increase the risk of side effects.",
        "Your doctor will evaluate your current health status, treatment goals, and any changes in your condition and decide the safest way to resume Mounjaro.",
        "How do I administer my dose correctly?",
        "For Mounjaro to work properly, it’s important to inject it safely and hygienically.",
        "Check out this step-by-step guide on how to inject Mounjaro properly so you can get the most out of it with fewer chances of post-injection complications.",
        "How do I manage Mounjaro side effects?",
        "Some people experience side effects in the first few weeks of taking Mounjaro. These effects are seen as a result of increasing the dose.",
        "The milder effects, like nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc., are usually temporary and get better with time.",
        "If you wish to manage Mounjaro side effects, here are some things you can try:",

What is Mounjaro & how does it work? The only drug in its class, Mounjaro, is a dual-action drug that activates two hormones in the gut: GLP-1 and GIP. It is approved for weight loss treatment in India and is available as a once-weekly injection. When injected correctly, Mounjaro does the following: Control appetite Reduce food cravings Help manage calorie intake Curb blood sugar levels Because this mechanism affects multiple organs, the body often needs time to adapt to it. That’s why your doctor will get you started on the lowest Mounjaro dose and gradually increase the dosage over the next few weeks. This helps you adjust gently to the weight loss medicine with reduced side effects. Mounjaro dosage chart Doctors prescribe Mounjaro at the lowest, safest dose, i.e., 2.5 mg. The doses are usually increased every four weeks. About your dosages: 2.5 mg dose: Starting dosage to help your body adjust to the medicine. 5 mg dose: Standard maintenance dosage for most patients. 7.5 mg to 15 mg dose: Additional dosages offered for further weight loss support. Here is a typical Mounjaro dosing schedule doctors usually follow. Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice: Note: At your next checkup, talk to your doctor about how you're feeling on both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses. Your progress so far will help them decide if you should increase your dose further. How do doctors decide which dose is right for you? Everyone’s weight loss journey is different — and so is your Mounjaro dose. Your doctor will start you on a small dose and slowly adjust it depending on how your body reacts. They’ll look at things like: Your goals: Some people do well on lower doses, others need a gradual increase for steady results. Your progress: Are you losing weight comfortably? Side effects: Any nausea or bloating that needs care? Your health: If you have any liver or kidney concerns, your doctor may go slower. Health reports: Are your blood pressure, thyroid levels, or blood sugar levels normal? There’s no rush. The goal is to find the dose that suits your body best, helps you lose weight safely, and keeps you feeling well throughout the journey. How to monitor your response to dose changes? One of the best and most useful ways to understand how your body responds to changes, be it medication, diet, or exercise, is tracking. You can simply enter your daily glucose readings, weight, and any side effects experienced in a diary. If fitness apps work for you, give them a go! A written record of your response to dose changes can also help your doctor monitor your health. This way, you play a more proactive role in taking charge of your health and maximising your doctor appointments. What to do if you miss a dose? When you cannot take your dose within four days of the scheduled injection, it is counted as a missed dose. However, there is no need to panic if this happens. Here’s what you can do: If it’s been less than four days (96 hours) since your scheduled injection, you can still take the missed dose. If more than four days have passed, skip that week’s dose and continue with your usual schedule the following week. Never take two doses at once or try to “catch up” by injecting more. Mounjaro Dosage Schedule : You can take one dose on any day shown in the ‘missed dose’ row. If it’s a day, skip the dose and wait for your next regular dosing day. Important: To change the day of taking the medication, keep a gap of at least three full days, or 72 hours, between the two doses. When should you pause or lower your dose? Sometimes, the body needs more time to adjust to a particular dose of Mounjaro. Certain situations may warrant you to lower your dose or pause it altogether: If the side effects are too severe or persistent. If you get pregnant while on Mounjaro. If you have issues with your liver or kidneys. If you have trouble tolerating a higher dose. If you experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), especially if you are on other anti-diabetes medications too. Always keep your doctor in the loop. Even small updates can help them support you better. Also read: Side effects of Mounjaro and how to manage them How to ensure a smoother dose escalation? Adapting to any new medication, especially one that affects your appetite and glucose metabolism, takes some time. But with these small changes, you can adapt to the new dose better: Eat light and chew slowly during the first few days. Drink enough water throughout the day. You can try light activities like walking, yoga, or gentle stretching to keep nausea in check. Always keep emergency contacts readily accessible in case of an allergic reaction. How to manage side effects due to dose increase Eat small, light meals. Drink enough water. Walk, do yoga, or try gentle stretches. In case of allergic reactions, keep emergency contact information ready. Go at your own pace, but with proper medical supervision The Mounjaro dosage chart has been carefully designed while keeping your safety, comfort, and health goals as the top priority. Some people see results early, while others take a little longer. And that’s okay. You just need to be consistent and patient and work closely with your doctor to find the dose that works best for you. FAQs What is the best time of the day to take Mounjaro? The good thing about taking Mounjaro is that you don’t have to worry about taking it before or after meals. This doesn’t affect how well it works. The key is to choose a time that’s easiest and most convenient for you to remember. This helps you stay consistent with your doses and stick to your schedule. So to make things easier, take it on the same day and at the same time every week. What if I accidentally take the wrong dose? If you take a higher dose than prescribed, contact your doctor immediately. Mild overdose may cause nausea or vomiting, but a severe overdose requires urgent medical attention. Can I split my weekly dose into smaller doses? No. Mounjaro is designed and prescribed to be taken once a week only. Splitting the dose can reduce its effectiveness and increase the chances of side effects. Does the dose affect how fast I lose weight? Not always. Weight loss depends on how your body responds. Some people lose more weight on lower doses, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Will increasing my dose reduce my hunger even more? Yes. Increasing the dose may increase the suppression of appetite. This is because GLP-1 and GIP activity is increased, which sends stronger ‘fullness signals’ to the brain. Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro? You can take alcohol while on Mounjaro, but only in moderation. Heavy drinking can aggravate the side effects and pose a risk to your overall health. Consult your doctor to know more. Can I inject Mounjaro at a different time each week? Ideally, it is preferable to take Mounjaro on the same day and time each week. But if you do need to change your injection day or time, maintain a gap of at least 72 hours from the previous dose. How do I know if the medication is working? Monitor your weight, appetite, and energy to understand if Mounjaro is actually working for you. If the medicine is working, you will experience less cravings, more energy, and eventually, weight loss. Your blood pressure and blood sugar levels will stabilise. How long should I stay on Mounjaro? The length of treatment with Mounjaro depends on your health goals. You may need to take this medication anywhere from six months to several years. For example, people with type 2 diabetes may need to take Mounjaro long-term to manage blood sugar levels. For weight loss and maintenance, your doctor will guide you on when and how to stop taking Moujaro gradually and safely. Can I stop Mounjaro for a month and restart where I left off? When it comes to any medication, especially Mounjaro, it’s best to consult your doctor before stopping or restarting it after a break. You may need to restart at a lower dose, like 2.5 mg, rather than resuming your previous dose. This is because your body’s tolerance to the medication may decrease during the break. Jumping back to a higher dose could increase the risk of side effects. Your doctor will evaluate your current health status, treatment goals, and any changes in your condition and decide the safest way to resume Mounjaro. How do I administer my dose correctly? For Mounjaro to work properly, it’s important to inject it safely and hygienically. Check out this step-by-step guide on how to inject Mounjaro properly so you can get the most out of it with fewer chances of post-injection complications. How do I manage Mounjaro side effects? Some people experience side effects in the first few weeks of taking Mounjaro. These effects are seen as a result of increasing the dose. The milder effects, like nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc., are usually temporary and get better with time. If you wish to manage Mounjaro side effects, here are some things you can try: Start with a low dose and increase it slowly. Eat small, bland meals and avoid fatty, spicy, or greasy foods. Drink plenty of water or electrolytes. Take Mounjaro with food if your doctor advises you to. Avoid drinking caffeine, alcohol, and fruit juices if you have diarrhoea. Rest whenever you feel unwell. Reach out to your doctor immediately if you have severe pain, persistent vomiting, symptoms of low blood sugar, allergic reactions, or swelling. View programme Do I qualify?

But before that, here’s what you should know about Mounjaro launch in India. Mounjaro launch in India: All you need to know about it Eli Lilly and Company (India) has announced the launch of Mounjaro, a one-of-a-kind weight loss and type 2 diabetes injection in India. Mounjaro is approved in India by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). It is available in India as well as in major parts of the world in the form of a pre-filled injection pen with single-use, disposable needles. Mounjaro is designed for chronic weight management. It is supposed to be used alongside a balanced diet and adequate exercise in individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of: 30 kg/m2 or more 27 kg/m2 or more + at least one weight-related condition Mounjaro is also used to manage type 2 diabetes in addition to diet and exercise. Aktive's weight loss programme is: Clinically-proven Globally-acclaimed Trusted by thousands of users Check if you're eligible What is Mounjaro? Mounjaro is a prescription-only, once-weekly injection that is used for weight management and type 2 diabetes control. Its active ingredient, Tirzepatide, removes excess sugar from the blood and slows digestion, which makes you feel fuller for longer and lose weight. Developed by Eli Lilly, Mounjaro activates GIP-1 and GLP-1 to trigger insulin control and weight loss. Mounjaro is available in multiple doses, starting from 2.5 mg, then increasing to 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, and 15 mg, which is the highest dose. How does Mounjaro work? Mounjaro’s active ingredient, Tirzepatide, is a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor as well as a glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonist. For the unversed, GIP is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and metabolism. It encourages fat reduction and prevents fat accumulation, helping you manage weight. GLP-1, on the other hand, is a hormone in the body that regulates appetite and insulin production. The hormone curbs hunger and makes you feel fuller for longer, helping you manage calorie intake. Tirzepatide mimics these hormones and works in five simple ways: When the body releases too much sugar in the blood, it helps the body release more insulin to curb sugar levels. It helps the body remove excessive sugar from the blood. It stops the liver from making and releasing further sugar into the blood. It signals the brain to eat less, thereby suppressing appetite and unnecessary bingeing. It slows down the speed at which the food leaves the stomach. This helps lose weight over time. How much weight can you lose with Mounjaro? Mounjaro is finally available in India. So, of course, the first question that comes to mind is: Does Mounjaro really help lose weight? The answer is - Yes, it does! In fact, several studies have shown that Mounjaro is a revolutionary weight loss injection that can help people tackle obesity with ease. In a study [1] published in Nature Medicine, involving 579 obese adults (with an average weight of 109.5 kg) who were given Tirzepatide over 12 weeks, results showed: Participants who took Tirzepatide lost 6.9% (7.6 kg) of their body weight. Participants who continued taking Tirzepatide even after the 12-week trial period lost an additional 21.1% of their body weight. Overall, participants who took Tirzepatide lost 26.6% (29.2 kg) of their body weight over 84 weeks. In comparison, participants who took placebo lost only 3.8% (4.1 kg) of their body weight over 84 weeks. This study clearly shows that Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) can help people lose a significant amount of weight in a short period. Are you eligible to take Mounjaro? We have now established that Mounjaro helps people effortlessly lose weight. However, can anyone who considers himself/herself overweight or obese take the weight loss injection in India?

This also means that your doctor should find it reasonable to prescribe Mounjaro to you.

This is why, it is very important to make the following lifestyle changes when you take Mounjaro for weight loss in India. Lifestyle changes to make while taking Mounjaro Eat well Eat healthy foods that are low in calories to prevent weight gain. You can swap your ice cream with a crunchy, crispy, juicy apple. Or substitute wheat rotis with a millet one. Have light dinners - tomato soup and some rice or millet khichdi are easy to digest and help you stay away from fats. Exercise well Exercise goes a long way in keeping the lost weight off. Simply try doing 3 minutes of exercise or activity every 30 minutes for best results. You can walk a bit, dance a bit, clean a bit, play a bit, or workout a bit - whatever makes you happy. Think well Stress can cause weight gain. Relax, breathe, and take in all the positivity around you to beat that stress. Meditate when you get time. Even 10 minutes a day can go a long way. Think about good things. Keep a journal. You are losing weight. Why not celebrate? Sleep well Getting less than 7 hours of sleep every night is not good for health. Get at least 7 hours of sleep. Try guided meditation to fall asleep. White noise in the background works even better. Stay away from blue light before bedtime - your phones and television screens are for the daytime. Try scented candles at night for a fragrance-filled sleep. What are the alternatives to Mounjaro? Not quite. Weight loss injection Wegovy has been approved for use in India in June 2025. Around the world, Ozempic and Zepbound are available as weight loss injections for those struggling with obesity. Ozempic was approved in India in December 2025, but Zepbound has yet to receive approval in India. Are Mounjaro and Wegovy the only weight loss medicines available in India? No. There is Rybelsus . Manufactured by Novo Nordisk, Rybelsus is approved in India as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but its active ingredient, Semaglutide, also leads to weight loss. However, Rybelsus is not approved for weight loss in India. So, is there an alternative at all? Yes. Aktive offers a weight loss programme, designed for Indians looking to lose weight without going through complicated fad diets, intense workout routines, and haywire schedules. With Aktive’s clinically-proven weight loss treatment, you can lose upto 21% of your body weight within a year. Do I qualify To sum it up… Mounjaro is here. Weight loss is no longer a distant dream for those struggling with obesity and type 2 diabetes. But Mounjaro is not magic. You can inject it with all your might, but without a good diet and the right exercise, you will most likely not see results. To sum it up, Mounjaro is a means to an end, and not the end goal itself. But at least, India can take a step forward and defeat obesity with Mounjaro. That’s news worth celebrating. FAQs How long does Mounjaro take to work? Mounjaro starts working right after the first dose. However, if you are wondering about the timeline for weight loss after starting Mounjaro, it is different for different individuals. Some people may notice they are losing weight with Mounjaro earlier than expected. For others, Mounjaro may take time to show its effect due to various factors such as diet, exercise, age, and health conditions. Contact your doctor if you are not losing at least 5% of your body weight within one year of starting Mounjaro. Does Mounjaro interact with any other medicines? Yes. Mounjaro can interact with other medicines you are currently taking and vice versa. These include diabetic medicines such as sulfonylureas or insulin, medicines such as warfarin, or oral hormonal contraceptives. What should I do if I am taking oral hormonal contraceptives before starting Mounjaro? If you are planning to start Mounjaro, but are taking oral hormonal contraceptives, talk to your doctor about it. Your doctor may switch you to a non-oral contraceptive method or advise you to use a barrier method such as a condom for 4 weeks after starting Mounjaro and for 4 weeks after every change in dosage. Can I change the day of the week for taking Mounjaro? Yes, you can change the day of the week initially scheduled for taking Mounjaro. However, it is important to keep a gap of at least 3 days or 72 hours between two Mounjaro doses. Can Mounjaro cause pancreatitis? Yes, in some patients who were treated for obesity with GLP-1 medicines, acute pancreatitis has been observed. Mounjaro is no exception. However, your doctor will monitor you for signs of pancreatitis after starting Mounjaro. These signs include: severe stomach pain, pain that can radiate to the back, and vomiting. If you notice any such signs, inform your doctor. In case of pancreatitis, your doctor may ask you to discontinue Mounjaro. Can Mounjaro cause hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels? Yes, one of the side effects of Mounjaro can be hypoglycemia, which means blood sugar levels have dropped. Signs of hypoglycemia include: dizziness or light-headedness, sweating, blurred vision, irritability or mood changes, slurred speech, shakiness, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, feeling jittery, increased heart rate, etc. If you notice any such signs, monitor your blood sugar levels immediately and contact your doctor. What if I do not have a sharps container to dispose of Mounjaro injection pen? If you do not have a sharps container for disposing of Mounjaro injection pen, you can use a normal household container. But make sure that the container is made of heavy-duty, durable plastic, has an air-tight lid that doesn’t allow needles to fall off from the container, and is leak-resistant. Should I use my Mounjaro injection pen if I see air bubbles in it? Air bubbles are normal. You can use your Mounjaro injection pen even when you notice air bubbles. You might also see a drop of liquid at the tip of the needle during priming the pen. This is normal too. But, under any circumstances, do not touch the needle. I heard more than 2 clicks while using my pen. What should I do? Sometimes, you may hear three clicks while using the pen - two loud clicks and one 1 soft click. The soft click may occur before the second loud click. This is normal. Do not remove the pen from the skin until you hear the second loud click. What if I feel my pen has not worked the right way? If you feel your Mounjaro pen is not working the right way, contact our customer support team for further instructions. View programme Do I qualify?

        "Not necessarily. Mild side effects are expected and often temporary. However, if you’re experiencing persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, mood changes, or signs of dehydration, it is best to stop and consult your doctor immediately.",
        "Are Mounjaro side effects worse at higher doses?",
        "They can be. Each dose escalation may bring back or intensify symptoms like nausea, fatigue, or digestive upset. That’s why gradual increases, as per your doctor’s advice, are important.",
        "Does everyone experience side effects from Mounjaro?",
        "No, side effects vary from person to person. Some people experience minimal discomfort, while others may struggle during the first few weeks. Factors like diet, other medications, and medical history influence your experience.",
        "Does Mounjaro cause hair loss or thinning?",
        "Hair loss isn't listed as a known side effect of Mounjaro, but some users have reported it anecdotally. This might be due to rapid weight loss, calorie restriction, or nutritional deficiencies. If you notice excessive hair fall, do check with your doctor.",
        "Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro?",
        "Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects like nausea and low blood sugar, more so in people with diabetes. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol, especially when you have just started out. Always ask your doctor what’s safe for you.",
        "Can side effects change from dose to dose?",
        "Yes. Even if you tolerated a lower dose well, side effects may reappear briefly when your dose is increased. That’s why titration (gradual increase) is built into most Mounjaro regimens.",
        "Can I take Mounjaro if I have IBS or other gut issues?",
        "Caution is advised. Mounjaro may worsen GI symptoms like bloating, constipation, or diarrhoea — especially in people with IBS, IBD, or a history of gut sensitivity. Discuss your condition with your doctor before starting it.",
        "Is it safe to take Mounjaro during your period or if you have PCOS?",
        "There’s no evidence that Mounjaro worsens menstrual symptoms.",
        "In fact, for women with PCOS, weight loss and insulin sensitivity improvements may support hormonal balance. However, consult your gynaecologist if your periods become irregular or heavier while on Mounjaro.",
        "Can Mounjaro cause weight loss that's too fast or unhealthy?",
        "Yes, some people may lose weight more quickly than intended, especially if they’re unable to eat enough due to nausea or appetite suppression.",
        "But rapid weight loss can lead to fatigue, hair thinning, or muscle loss. If you're losing more than 1–1.5 kg per week, you may need to talk to your doctor or dietitian about adjusting your food intake.",
        "Can I take over-the-counter medicines to help with side effects?",
        "Some people use remedies like antacids, fibre supplements, or anti-nausea meds — but always check with your doctor before combining anything with Mounjaro. Drug interactions are possible.",
        "Can I take Mounjaro while pregnant?",
        "It’s best not to take Mounjaro during pregnancy. At present, there isn’t enough data on how safe it is for pregnant women. Animal studies have shown possible harm to the baby, such as developmental issues.",
        "If you find out you’re pregnant while on Mounjaro, stop taking it right away and speak to your doctor about further course of action.",
        "Can I take Mounjaro while breastfeeding?",
        "Mounjaro isn’t recommended if you’re breastfeeding.",
        "There are no studies in humans yet. While animal studies show that the drug might pass into breast milk, we’re not sure how it affects babies. It’s safest to check with your doctor for better alternatives to manage your health during this time.",

Key takeaways: Mounjaro may cause mild side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, constipation, and vomiting. Most side effects are common in the early weeks and usually settle with time. Stay hydrated and eat small, frequent meals to manage nausea and fatigue. Uncommon but serious side effects like pancreatitis, severe dehydration, or allergic reaction need prompt medical attention. Every person may react differently to Mounjaro, but proper care and healthy choices can help. Maybe you saw it in the news. Maybe it's the hot topic of your family chat group. Or maybe you saw another celebrity go through a major weight loss transformation. Mounjaro has made headlines worldwide as a new medicine for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity.

This guide will help you understand the side effects of taking Mounjaro, what they look like, and how they can be managed. How does Mounjaro work? Before we discuss Mounjaro’s side effects, it is helpful to understand how the weight loss medicine works. This medicine copies the actions of two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP. Whenever we eat, these hormones come into action and: Control blood sugar levels: This is made possible by helping the body use insulin more effectively. Slow down digestion: As Mounjaro slows down the rate at which your stomach empties food, you feel full for a longer time. Sends fullness signals to the brain: By triggering the neurons, they signal the brain that you’re full, which makes it easier to eat less. This way, you: Feel satisfied with smaller portions. Experience less hunger between meals. Have fewer food cravings. Process sugar more efficiently. Gradually lose weight. How does Mounjaro work? Copies gut hormones (GLP-1 & GIP) Slows digestion so you stay satisfied longer Signals your brain that you’re full Smaller portions keep you full Fewer cravings between meals Steadier bloos sugar control Gradual, healthy weight loss Because Mounjaro slows digestion and changes how your gut communicates with your brain, your body needs time to adjust.

But adapting to them can be uncomfortable in the beginning. That’s why doctors start with a low dose and increase it gradually to give your gut time to adapt.

A lump or swelling in the neck Hoarseness of voice Difficulty in swallowing or breathing How to manage common side effects of Mounjaro? Don’t worry. The good news is that the mild side effects can be managed at home with a few simple steps. But if the symptoms don’t settle or seem to get worse, see your doctor without delay. How to manage Mounjaro side effects For nausea: Eat 5–6 small meals instead of 3 large ones. Begin your meals with thin dal or clear soup. Reduce your intake of masala and oil for some time. Eat slowly and chew thoroughly. Drink adrak chai, pudina tea, jeera water, or nimbu paani. Try nimbu pani with black salt. Use pudina chutney or hing in dals. For vomiting: Drink ORS. Have khichdi , or curd rice, once you are able to eat. Avoid lying down immediately after meals. Take small sips of water frequently. Try evening injections to sleep through symptoms. For diarrhoea: Rehydrate with nimbu paani, nariyal paani, or lassi. Eat rice, banana, and curd. Avoid leafy greens and high-fibre foods. Try isabgol (psyllium husk) after medical advice. For constipation: Drink 8–10 glasses of water daily. Try triphala churna (only after consulting your doctor). Add soaked methi seeds to your diet. Increase your intake of vegetables, whole grains, and papaya. For decreased appetite: Focus on protein-rich foods like dal, paneer, soya, etc. Eat 4-6 small meals instead of 3 large meals, on fixed timings. Eat nutrient-dense, seasonal vegetables. Consider a multivitamin (only on the recommendation of a doctor). Eat only when hungry, and do not force-feed yourself. For fatigue: Stay well-hydrated. Add energy-giving foods like ragi, jowar, sattu, etc. Maintain adequate protein intake. Include iron-rich foods like spinach and beetroot. For headaches: Hydrate well. Maintain a regular sleep routine. Use over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Try tulsi or chamomile tea for cooling relief. For injection site reactions: Rotate the injection sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm). Let the alcohol dry fully before injecting. Use a cold compress if there's discomfort. While some side effects are expected or mild and resolve on their own, serious side effects may need immediate medical attention. What makes some people more sensitive to Mounjaro than others? But why are some people more prone to side effects than others? There can be different reasons, like: How your body processes Mounjaro Your present health status Your gut health Your past medical history How quickly has the dose been/is increased Your lifestyle and eating habits Your consistency in taking Mounjaro Any possible drug interactions When should you visit the doctor? Reach out to your doctor if you notice/experience: Severe pain in the abdomen, especially if it spreads to the back or is accompanied by fever and/or vomiting Severe or persistent diarrhoea or vomiting Pain in the upper abdominal region, yellowing of skin/eyes (jaundice), or fever Shaking, sweating, confusion, dizziness, or fainting A rash, swelling (of the face, lips, or throat), or trouble breathing A lump in the neck, difficulty swallowing, or hoarseness of voice Your symptoms persist or worsen, especially after an increase in dose The side effects affect your ability to eat, work, or function New symptoms, but not directly related to taking Mounjaro (hair loss, fatigue, etc.) Difficulty in tolerating side effects every time the dose changes Do the side effects go away over time? The good news is that most people who take Mounjaro gradually adapt to the side effects, especially the common gastrointestinal ones. These usually last for 3 months and get better as the body learns to adjust. But this can be different for different people. In studies like the SURMOUNT-4 [5] trial (that lasted up to 72 weeks), most common side effects diminished after 16–24 weeks, but some users reported mild, intermittent symptoms with continued use. Serious side effects like pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, or kidney issues do not resolve spontaneously and need a different approach/medical intervention. Practical tips to feel better while your body adjusts “Whatever weight loss that you get on Mounjaro or Sema or Ozempic for that matter, 30% of that weight loss is your muscle mass loss. So to prevent that, your diet should include more of protein like fish and chicken. Among the vegetarians, you have pulses, paneer, soya, and tofu.” - Dr. Vijay Panikar, consultant endocrinologist, Lilavati Hospital In addition to the advice above, here are some simple tips you can try: Eat light and nutritious foods. For example, swap ice cream with fruits, or a wheat roti for a millet one. Try to get a minimum of 7 hours of good-quality sleep. Make sure you do a minimum of 30 minutes of physical activity daily. You can break it down to small 10-minute workouts if you like. Add small, simple stress management techniques to your routine, like deep breathing, journaling, or meditation. Everybody reacts differently, and that's okay. Some people feel completely at ease while taking Mounjaro. Others may feel tired, nauseous or off-balance before things settle. But knowing what to expect and when to reach out for help can make all the difference.

Some people experience minimal discomfort, while others may struggle during the first few weeks. Factors like diet, other medications, and medical history influence your experience. Does Mounjaro cause hair loss or thinning? Hair loss isn't listed as a known side effect of Mounjaro, but some users have reported it anecdotally. This might be due to rapid weight loss, calorie restriction, or nutritional deficiencies. If you notice excessive hair fall, do check with your doctor. Can I drink alcohol while taking Mounjaro? Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects like nausea and low blood sugar, more so in people with diabetes. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol, especially when you have just started out. Always ask your doctor what’s safe for you. Can side effects change from dose to dose? Yes. Even if you tolerated a lower dose well, side effects may reappear briefly when your dose is increased. That’s why titration (gradual increase) is built into most Mounjaro regimens. Can I take Mounjaro if I have IBS or other gut issues? Caution is advised. Mounjaro may worsen GI symptoms like bloating, constipation, or diarrhoea — especially in people with IBS, IBD, or a history of gut sensitivity. Discuss your condition with your doctor before starting it. Is it safe to take Mounjaro during your period or if you have PCOS? There’s no evidence that Mounjaro worsens menstrual symptoms. In fact, for women with PCOS, weight loss and insulin sensitivity improvements may support hormonal balance. However, consult your gynaecologist if your periods become irregular or heavier while on Mounjaro. Can Mounjaro cause weight loss that's too fast or unhealthy? Yes, some people may lose weight more quickly than intended, especially if they’re unable to eat enough due to nausea or appetite suppression. But rapid weight loss can lead to fatigue, hair thinning, or muscle loss. If you're losing more than 1–1.5 kg per week, you may need to talk to your doctor or dietitian about adjusting your food intake. Can I take over-the-counter medicines to help with side effects? Some people use remedies like antacids, fibre supplements, or anti-nausea meds — but always check with your doctor before combining anything with Mounjaro. Drug interactions are possible. Can I take Mounjaro while pregnant? It’s best not to take Mounjaro during pregnancy. At present, there isn’t enough data on how safe it is for pregnant women. Animal studies have shown possible harm to the baby, such as developmental issues. If you find out you’re pregnant while on Mounjaro, stop taking it right away and speak to your doctor about further course of action. Can I take Mounjaro while breastfeeding? Mounjaro isn’t recommended if you’re breastfeeding. There are no studies in humans yet. While animal studies show that the drug might pass into breast milk, we’re not sure how it affects babies. It’s safest to check with your doctor for better alternatives to manage your health during this time. How can I manage Mounjaro side effects during weddings or festivals? Adjusting to Mounjaro might be slightly tricky during festivals, but here is how you can enjoy worry-free: Eat a simple, light meal before attending the event. Pick mild food options from the buffet, like plain rice, dal, salad, curd or lightly spiced sabzis. Stay hydrated with water, nimbu paani , or coconut water, especially in warm weather or long events. If possible, avoid increasing your dose just before the function. You can plan this timing with your doctor. View programme Do I qualify?

        "“How do I manage fatigue, digestion, or sleep on Mounjaro?”",

        "You want to feel fewer food cravings, more energy, and better control over your health.",
        "However, people often miss one thing. Mounjaro is a powerful tool for weight loss. But how much you lose and how you keep it off depends on what you do alongside it.",
        "And that’s where lifestyle plays a major role.",
        "In the sections ahead, you’ll find some practical lifestyle tips to follow while taking Mounjaro for weight loss.",
        "Although Mounjaro can affect your appetite, what you choose to eat still matters.",
        "Colourful sabzis, home-cooked meals, whole grains, etc., will take you further than a packet of chips.",
        "Eat foods rich in protein, fibre, healthy fats, and micronutrients, so your body gets what it needs even when you're eating less.",
        "You don’t need to hit the gym or sign up for a fancy fitness class. When you're on Mounjaro, even small amounts of movement can result in:",
        "Drinking water may sound like simple advice. But it matters when you're on Mounjaro",
        "Since Mounjaro slows down your digestion, you might deal with side effects like constipation, bloating, or nausea.",
        "And not drinking enough water can make these issues worse. If you have diabetes, dehydration can interfere with your blood sugar levels, which is the last thing you need.",
        "Learn more about managing Mounjaro’s side effects.",
        "If you're not sleeping well, you may be undoing all your hard work.",
        "Even if you're eating right, not getting your daily dose of quality sleep can lead to fat gain and muscle loss.",
        "Staying up late and eating late can confuse hunger hormones (ghrelin, leptin, and GLP-1). This leads to fat storage over time. But sleeping well can reverse these effects.",
        "In fact, a study[1] showed that increasing your snooze time by one hour can reduce daily calorie intake by 270 calories.",
        "Stress can heavily sabotage weight loss.",
        "Whenever people feel distressed, they tend to gravitate to comfort foods. This can include anything from sweets and chocolates to fatty and fried foods.",
        "This happens because stress increases cortisol levels[2] in the body. As a result, your appetite for high-fat and sugary foods increases significantly.",
        "Want to know more about different food cravings and how to manage them easily? This guide will help.",
        "The best part about setting realistic goals is that you don't have to overhaul everything overnight.",

        "Regular check-ins with the doctor are a valuable way of catching any issues in time.",
        "Ever since its release in India, Mounjaro has revolutionised the science of weight management.",
        "Mounjaro is a highly effective solution for your weight loss problems. But its success is largely dependent on your lifestyle.",
        "Balanced eating, regular activity, good sleep, hydration, stress management, alongside a strong support system, are the pillars of long-term success with Mounjaro.",
        "But you need to be patient. Realistic targets and consistent efforts will get you farther than any dose of motivation ever can. With time, these habits will feel like second nature.",
        "Can I eat sweets while taking Mounjaro?",
        "Yes, you can, but in moderation. Sweets may reduce the blood sugar and weight-loss benefits of Mounjaro.",
        "However, you can occasionally enjoy small portions of low-sugar options, such as fresh fruit or dark chocolate (with 70% or higher cocoa content).",
        "Try to pair your sweets with protein, fibre, or nuts (like some berries with Greek yoghurt) so you can balance those post-meal sugar spikes.",
        "How can I manage nausea while taking Mounjaro?",
        "It is common to experience gastrointestinal side effects with Mounjaro. Nausea is one of them.",
        "To tackle nausea, eat small, frequent meals with bland, easy-to-digest foods such as biscuits, dals, soups, and rice.",
        "Avoid greasy, fatty, or spicy foods. Sip water or ginger tea throughout the day to calm your stomach. If nausea persists, contact your doctor as soon as possible.",
        "Can I drink alcohol while on Mounjaro?",
        "Moderate alcohol consumption may be okay for some, but for others, it can affect blood sugar and increase the chances of side effects.",
        "Sometimes, alcohol may also interact with Mounjaro and affect its beneficial action.",
        "You can stick to low-sugar options, such as dry wine or spirits with zero-calorie mixers. However, always consult your doctor before trying anything new.",
        "How do I know if I’m eating enough protein on Mounjaro?",
        "Try to eat 1.2–1.6g of protein per kg of body weight daily (for example, 80–100g for a 70 kg person). This will help you preserve your muscle mass.",
        "To ensure you get this much protein, try including a variety of protein sources, such as sprouts, dals, nuts, whole grains, paneer, eggs, chicken, fish, tofu, etc., in every meal.",
        "What if I miss a dose?",

You might be wondering: “What should I eat now that I don’t feel as hungry?” “Is exercise still important if I’m losing weight anyway?” “How do I manage fatigue, digestion, or sleep on Mounjaro?” In this article: Key takeaways: 1. Eat right, eat well 2. Stay fit, stay active 3. Hydrate well 4. Get enough sleep 5. Unwind and relax 6. Set realistic goals & track them right 7. Build a support system 8. Stay in touch with your doctor It starts with small changes Key takeaways: Mounjaro is a dual-action medication used for managing weight loss and type 2 diabetes. It works best when combined with a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, and quality sleep. Skipping meals, poor hydration, and low activity can affect weight loss and blood sugar. If you’ve started taking Mounjaro or are seriously considering it, chances are you’re hoping for more than just a number on the scale to change. You want to feel fewer food cravings, more energy, and better control over your health. However, people often miss one thing. Mounjaro is a powerful tool for weight loss. But how much you lose and how you keep it off depends on what you do alongside it . And that’s where lifestyle plays a major role. In the sections ahead, you’ll find some practical lifestyle tips to follow while taking Mounjaro for weight loss. Lifestyle changes to make while taking Mounjaro Eat a well-balanced diet Exercise regularly Get enough hydration Sleep for at least 8 hours Find ways to relax more Track your weight loss goals Build a support system Follow-up with your doctor 1. Eat right, eat well Although Mounjaro can affect your appetite, what you choose to eat still matters. Colourful sabzis , home-cooked meals, whole grains, etc., will take you further than a packet of chips. Eat foods rich in protein, fibre, healthy fats, and micronutrients , so your body gets what it needs even when you're eating less. How to eat healthy on Mounjaro: Swap your ice cream for a crunchy, crispy, juicy apple. Substitute wheat rotis with rotis made from millets like ragi , jowar , or bajra . Have light, low-fat dinners — tomato soup and some rice or millet khichdi are easy to digest. Too much salt can cause bloating and isn’t great for blood pressure. Use herbs, spices, or citrus zest to add flavour. 2. Stay fit, stay active You don’t need to hit the gym or sign up for a fancy fitness class. When you're on Mounjaro, even small amounts of movement can result in: Better insulin sensitivity. Better tolerance to the medication. Relief from constipation. More energy levels. Preserved muscle mass. Here are some of the best exercises for Mounjaro users: Try doing 3 minutes of exercise or activity every 30 minutes. Dance a bit, clean a bit, play a bit, or work out a bit — whatever makes you happy. Begin with low-impact activities, such as swimming or gentle yoga. New to exercise? Surya namaskar is a great place to start. Set a goal of 10,000 steps a day or join a friend for walks every day. Track your activity using a phone app or wearable device. 3. Hydrate well Drinking water may sound like simple advice. But it matters when you're on Mounjaro Since Mounjaro slows down your digestion, you might deal with side effects like constipation, bloating, or nausea. And not drinking enough water can make these issues worse. If you have diabetes, dehydration can interfere with your blood sugar levels, which is the last thing you need. Learn more about managing Mounjaro’s side effects . How to stay well-hydrated on Mounjaro: Sip water throughout the day. If plain water seems boring, consider trying equally hydrating, low-calorie options like herbal teas, jeera water , buttermilk, and lemon or cucumber-infused water. Eat more fibre-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dals, chia seeds , and sabja seeds. 4. Get enough sleep If you're not sleeping well, you may be undoing all your hard work. Even if you're eating right, not getting your daily dose of quality sleep can lead to fat gain and muscle loss. Staying up late and eating late can confuse hunger hormones (ghrelin, leptin, and GLP-1) . This leads to fat storage over time. But sleeping well can reverse these effects. In fact, a study [1] showed that increasing your snooze time by one hour can reduce daily calorie intake by 270 calories. How to increase your sleep quality: Get at least 7 hours of sleep. Try guided meditation to fall asleep. White noise in the background works even better. Stay away from blue light at least 1 hour before bedtime — your phone and television screens are for daytime use. Try scented candles at night for a fragrance-filled sleep. 5. Unwind and relax Stress can heavily sabotage weight loss. Whenever people feel distressed, they tend to gravitate to comfort foods. This can include anything from sweets and chocolates to fatty and fried foods. This happens because stress increases cortisol levels [2] in the body. As a result, your appetite for high-fat and sugary foods increases significantly. Here’s what you can do to prevent stress eating: Relax, breathe, and take in all the positivity around you to beat that stress. Meditate when you get time. Even 10 minutes a day can make a significant difference. Think about good things. Keep a journal. You are losing weight. Why not celebrate? Want to know more about different food cravings and how to manage them easily? This guide will help. 6. Set realistic goals & track them right The best part about setting realistic goals is that you don't have to overhaul everything overnight. Here are some doable things you can try: Take a 15-minute walk after dinner three times a week. Add a protein source to at least two meals a day. Note your findings in a basic notebook or a digital habit tracking app. Set check-in points at regular intervals of 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, or 12 months to monitor your progress. 7. Build a support system Did you know that your family has an equally important part to play in your weight loss? Here’s how you can lean on your loved ones: Ask a close friend or family member to help keep you on track. Create new traditions with your family, such as Baked Snacks Day or evening walks after dinner. Get your kids together for a hike on the weekend, so you hit your activity goals minus the boredom. 8. Stay in touch with your doctor While taking Mounjaro, you will need to stay in touch with your doctor periodically to ensure the medication is working as planned. Check-in with your doctor if: You feel that the symptoms, such as nausea, fatigue, or blood sugar issues, are persistent. You're unsure about how to adjust your dose. You're planning a medical procedure like an endoscopy. You’re pregnant or planning to get pregnant. You’re breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. Regular check-ins with the doctor are a valuable way of catching any issues in time. It starts with small changes Ever since its release in India, Mounjaro has revolutionised the science of weight management. Mounjaro is a highly effective solution for your weight loss problems. But its success is largely dependent on your lifestyle. Balanced eating, regular activity, good sleep, hydration, stress management, alongside a strong support system, are the pillars of long-term success with Mounjaro. But you need to be patient. Realistic targets and consistent efforts will get you farther than any dose of motivation ever can. With time, these habits will feel like second nature. FAQs Can I eat sweets while taking Mounjaro? Yes, you can, but in moderation. Sweets may reduce the blood sugar and weight-loss benefits of Mounjaro. However, you can occasionally enjoy small portions of low-sugar options, such as fresh fruit or dark chocolate (with 70% or higher cocoa content). Try to pair your sweets with protein, fibre, or nuts (like some berries with Greek yoghurt) so you can balance those post-meal sugar spikes. How can I manage nausea while taking Mounjaro? It is common to experience gastrointestinal side effects with Mounjaro. Nausea is one of them. To tackle nausea, eat small, frequent meals with bland, easy-to-digest foods such as biscuits, dals , soups, and rice. Avoid greasy, fatty, or spicy foods. Sip water or ginger tea throughout the day to calm your stomach. If nausea persists, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Can I drink alcohol while on Mounjaro? Moderate alcohol consumption may be okay for some, but for others, it can affect blood sugar and increase the chances of side effects. Sometimes, alcohol may also interact with Mounjaro and affect its beneficial action. You can stick to low-sugar options, such as dry wine or spirits with zero-calorie mixers. However, always consult your doctor before trying anything new. How do I know if I’m eating enough protein on Mounjaro? Try to eat 1.2–1.6g of protein per kg of body weight daily (for example, 80–100g for a 70 kg person). This will help you preserve your muscle mass. To ensure you get this much protein, try including a variety of protein sources, such as sprouts, dals , nuts, whole grains, paneer , eggs, chicken, fish, tofu, etc., in every meal. What if I miss a dose? If you miss a dose of Mounjaro, do the following: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, preferably within 4 days (96 hours) of the last missed dose. If more than 4 days have passed since you missed the dose, skip the missed dose and take your next scheduled dose as planned. Do not take more than one dose of Mounjaro within 3 days. Set a weekly reminder on your phone so you never miss a dose again. Should I follow a specific diet, such as the keto diet? There’s no one-size-fits-all diet for Mounjaro. However, studies have shown that calorie restriction is beneficial. A balanced, nutrient-dense diet with vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean protein works best. Keto may be too restrictive and isn’t necessary for Mounjaro. But if you’re considering it, consult a dietitian to ensure it meets your nutritional needs and aligns with Mounjaro’s effects. Will I regain weight after stopping Mounjaro? You may regain some weight after stopping Mounjaro, especially if you don't continue healthy habits. However, you can surely prevent weight regain if you stay active, eat well, get enough sleep, and manage stress properly. If you, however, do plan on stopping the medication, doing so under medical supervision with a proper step-down plan in place will be helpful. What can I do if I feel low on energy? Feeling low on energy can happen for a few reasons. With Mounjaro, it’s often linked to things like dehydration, eating too little , or missing out on essential nutrients . To feel better, try this: Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water a day. Eat small and balanced meals. Try to get 7-8 hours of sleep every day. Avoid accumulating any sleep debt. Even a short 10-minute walk can lift your energy. Doing so after meals prevents sugar crashes. If you still feel tired, it's best to speak to your doctor. They can check for any deficiencies or side effects that may be causing the fatigue. Does Mounjaro affect my cholesterol levels? Yes, Mounjaro may have a positive effect on cholesterol levels. In fact, studies have shown that people taking Mounjaro have experienced reduced levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides . In some cases, HDL (good cholesterol) levels improved . These benefits are likely due to the combined effects of weight loss, better blood sugar control, and improved insulin sensitivity. However, results can vary from person to person. If you already have high cholesterol or are on cholesterol-lowering medication, make sure to regularly monitor your levels. Also, keep your doctor informed about any latest developments in your health. Can I take supplements while on Mounjaro? Some supplements, like multivitamins or fibre, may be beneficial to your health. However, some supplements may interact with Mounjaro and affect its effectiveness. Always consult with your doctor before starting any supplements, so you know they’re safe and necessary for your goals. How do I know if my lifestyle changes are working with Mounjaro? We often tend to obsess over the changing numbers on the weighing scale. However, this is not the only metric we should focus on. To see if your lifestyle changes are working, track non-scale metrics, such as improved energy , mood , or blood sugar readings . Notice how your face looks or how your clothes fit. Are there any changes in your waist circumference? Note your progress monthly, and see the difference. View programme Do I qualify?

The company observed that semaglutide showed a 24% reduction in kidney disease progression. Cancer risk reduction: A study [3] was published in December 2023. It was noted that GLP-1 medicines, such as Ozempic, reduced colon cancer rates among type 2 diabetics. 18,518 diabetic people who took GLP-1s had a 25% reduction in colorectal cancer compared to 18,518 diabetic people who took metformin. Who can take Ozempic? If you want to take Ozempic for weight loss or diabetes management, you must meet at least one of the factors mentioned below: Age: 18 or older. Type 2 diabetes (not for type 1 diabetes). Unable to control blood glucose levels with other medicines. Overweight or obese adults with a BMI of: 30 kg/m2 27 kg/m2 if one or more weight-related complications are present Who should avoid Ozempic? Ozempic might not be suitable for everyone. Reconsider your decision if you: Have a history of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC). Have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome Type 2 (MEN 2). Have severe allergic reactions to semaglutide. Are pregnant. Use it only if the benefits outweigh the risks for your baby. Animal studies suggest it could be harmful. Are planning a pregnancy. Stop taking Ozempic at least two months before planning pregnancy. This is the time it takes to wash out from the system. Belong to one or more of the following special patient groups: Breastfeeding women: It isn't clear if Ozempic can pass into breast milk or affect a breastfeeding baby. But before using it, weigh the benefits and risks. Older population: There are no significant concerns regarding older patients taking the injection. However, some older individuals might be more sensitive to it. Kidney patients: Kidney patients can take this medicine without any dose adjustment. But careful monitoring is recommended. Liver patients: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with liver problems. But keep monitoring the effects. How to take Ozempic? Doctors prescribe Ozempic at the lowest strength and gradually work their way up. Ozempic acts best when injected under the skin. Places like the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm are rich in fatty tissue. So, they make for excellent administration sites. Check out a quick video below to understand how to use Ozempic injection pen. Follow these step-by-step instructions while injecting yourself with Ozempic: To prepare the pen: Wash your hands with soap and water. Ensure the pen says OZEMPIC® and the medicine inside is clear and colourless. Turn the dose selector to the flow check symbol. To use the injection: Remove the paper tab from a new needle. Push the needle straight onto the pen and twist until it’s tight. Take off both needle caps (keep the outer cap, discard the inner cap). To check the flow: Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold the dose button until the counter shows 0. Ensure a drop appears at the needle tip. If no drop appears, repeat up to six times, and change the needle if needed. Contact Novo Nordisk if it still doesn't work. To select the dose: Turn the dose selector to your prescribed dose (0.25 mg or 0.5 mg). Make sure the dose counter shows the exact dose you need. Remember to use a new needle for each injection. This helps prevent infection and ensures the correct dose. To select the injection site: Choose a spot on your stomach, thigh, or upper arm for the injection. Rotate injection sites to avoid using the same area repeatedly. Wipe the chosen injection site with an alcohol swab and let it dry. To inject your dose: Insert the needle into your skin as shown by your doctor. Press and hold the dose button until the counter shows 0. Count to 6 while pressing the button. Remove the needle from your skin. If blood appears, press lightly with gauze or cotton. Do not rub. You can always refer to the prescription guide for more information. Uncomfortable with needles? Then Rybelsus , the tablet form of semaglutide, is a great alternative.

        "1. All flattened rice varieties are exactly the same as poha .",
        "Different varieties of flattened rice exist across Asia, each with unique processing methods. Examples include Pinipig (Philippines), Ambok (Odisha), Mont Hsan (Myanmar), Khao Mao (Thailand), and Cốm (Vietnam).",
        "2. poha is universally easy to digest for everyone.",
        "While poha is generally easy to digest, some people with sensitive guts may have issues. Adding heavy spices, fats, nuts, or soya can also affect digestibility.",
        "3. Poha always causes stomach aches.",
        "Poha typically aids digestion due to its fiber content. Stomach issues may occur due to improper rinsing, specific ingredients, individual sensitivities, or pre-existing conditions.",
        "4. poha can completely replace vegetables in your diet.",
        "While nutritious, poha cannot replace vegetables entirely. Vegetables provide essential vitamins (A, C, K), minerals, folate, diverse fibers, phytochemicals, and antioxidants that poha alone cannot provide.",
        "Healthy eating doesn't have to be boring, and poha proves that. It is a great example of how something simple and affordable can be a healthy weight-loss meal. Be it the regular kande pohe, or the hatke poha chilla, you can whip up your delicacy without compromising on flavour or satisfaction.",

        "Can I eat poha while dieting?",
        "Yes, poha is an excellent meal choice for weight loss due to its low-calorie count (110-354 kcal/100g), high fibre, and complex carbohydrates. Together they help you sustain energy for longer periods of time without spiking blood sugar. It is a versatile ingredient and can be easily combined with different vegetables, protein sources, and nuts to help you with your weight loss goals.",
        "Is poha better than rice?",
        "Yes. poha is a healthier alternative to rice, the reasons behind this being:",
        "What are the disadvantages of eating poha?",
        "While poha can be weight-loss friendly when taken in moderation, it also has some disadvantages.",
        "Is poha a junk food?",
        "No! On the contrary, poha is a wholesome dish rich in fibre, carbohydrates, iron, vitamins, and minerals. It is best to eat homemade poha with adequate protein and vegetables so you get the best of its nutritional value.",
        "Can poha help in gaining weight?",
        "It depends on how you prepare poha , how much you eat, and what you eat it with. Adding calorie-dense foods like peanuts, nuts, seeds, potatoes, or extra oil can cause unhealthy weight gain. Some believe that adding grated coconut or serving it with curd can also increase its calorie content.",
        "Is poha gluten-free?",
        "Poha is flattened/flaked rice that does not contain gluten, as it is made from white and red rice. This makes it a complex carbohydrate and a convenient option for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.",
        "How does poha compare to oats for weight loss?",
        "Oats are nutrient-rich and pack more protein (10-13g) and fibre (10-11g) per 100g. This makes them more filling and helps control hunger. Their low glycemic index makes it easier to stabilise blood sugar levels.",
        "poha , on the other hand, is light and easy to digest, with 130-150 calories per 100g. But it contains less protein (2.5-3g) and fibre (1.5-2g) in comparison and may leave you hungry sooner. So, pick oats if you are looking for satiety and poha if you want a quick, light meal.",
        "Is poha suitable for people with diabetes?",
        "Definitely, because of its low glycemic index (38-64) and high fibre content, poha slows down the absorption of carbohydrates. This way, the sugar levels in the blood rise slowly and steadily, rather than in sudden spikes. You can prepare poha with minimal oil and add more veggies and protein to increase its nutritional value.",
        "How do I store poha, and what is its shelf life?",
        "As a dry food item, poha has a good shelf life of around six months to a year. Always try to store poha in airtight containers in a moisture-free, cool place to prevent mold and pest attacks. Check for a fresh smell, insects, etc., before you use poha .",
        "Can I prepare poha in advance?",
        "Yes, you can save time while cooking poha . For this, you can chop the vegetables and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator. This way, you only need to soak the poha before cooking and temper it with spices.",
        "Also, you can make your poha premix at home by roasting the poha , and then mixing it with spices, peanuts, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. Cool the mixture completely before storing it in an airtight container. Cooked poha can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days, but it’s best to enjoy it fresh.",
        "Is poha a complete meal on its own?",
        "Although poha is a low-calorie, nutritious meal, it still cannot compensate for our daily requirements of proteins, fats, and some other nutrients on its own. Combining it with healthy vegetables, legumes, or dahi can increase its nutritional value.",

      "main_text": "1. All flattened rice varieties are exactly the same as poha . True False Different varieties of flattened rice exist across Asia, each with unique processing methods. Examples include Pinipig (Philippines), Ambok (Odisha), Mont Hsan (Myanmar), Khao Mao (Thailand), and Cốm (Vietnam). 2. poha is universally easy to digest for everyone. True False While poha is generally easy to digest, some people with sensitive guts may have issues. Adding heavy spices, fats, nuts, or soya can also affect digestibility. 3. Poha always causes stomach aches. True False Poha typically aids digestion due to its fiber content. Stomach issues may occur due to improper rinsing, specific ingredients, individual sensitivities, or pre-existing conditions. 4. poha can completely replace vegetables in your diet. True False While nutritious, poha cannot replace vegetables entirely. Vegetables provide essential vitamins (A, C, K), minerals, folate, diverse fibers, phytochemicals, and antioxidants that poha alone cannot provide. Show Final Score Your Score: 0 out of 4",

But, does it come with its terms and conditions? Read on to know more.",
        "Tej Mahboobani, a 35-year-old hospitality professional, had to constantly be on his toes for long hours at work. Breaks were small and infrequent. So, whenever Mahboobani managed to find some time to eat, he would grab a fried, processed snack to munch on. The result was disastrous. Mahboobani began to weigh 116 kg. Soon, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. If he didn’t do anything soon, he would end up with diabetes - and things would just go downhill from there on.",
        "Thankfully, he found out about Rybelsus - an oral form of semaglutide. Within months, Mahboobani managed to cut down his weight from 116 kgs to 99 kgs.",
        "In an interview with The Indian Express, Mahboobani says he can now, “walk an hour every day, squeeze in 15 minutes of exercise, snack on salads, have dinner by 7 pm and sleep by 10 pm.” This is the magic Rybelsus brings to life.",
        "But what exactly is Rybelsus? How does an oral tablet help people lose weight and manage their glucose levels? Isn’t this too good to be true? Read on to find your answer.",
        "Rybelsus is the oral form of semaglutide. It is prescribed for type 2 diabetes management. The FDA approved it in 2019. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation approved Rybelsus in India in 2022 for managing type 2 diabetes. It is currently available in three dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg.",
        "Even though Rybelsus is approved to manage type 2 diabetes, since it helps people lose weight simultaneously, doctors do sometimes prescribe it ‘off-label’ for weight loss as well.",
        "Semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Rybelsus, is a GLP - 1 receptor agonist. Don’t let the phrase put you off. GLP-1 is a hormone that naturally occurs in our bodies.",
        "This is what it does in our body:",
        "GLP-1 hormone signals the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar levels rise. This moves sugar into the cells to generate energy.",
        "The hormone slows down the pace of the movement of food through the stomach. This results in feeling fuller for longer after eating.",
        "The hormone decreases sugar production in the liver when it is not required.",
        "GLP-1 also affects the areas of the brain that control appetite. As a result, you end up feeling less hungry.",
        "Semaglutide mimics this hormone in the body, eventually resulting in type 2 diabetes management and weight loss.",
        "Rybelsus works exactly the same way as semaglutide - it makes the pancreas release more insulin, stops the liver from producing too much sugar, signals the brain to eat less, and slows down gastric emptying.",
        "This simple function of the medicine has helped millions of people worldwide and in India become healthier versions of themselves within a year.",
        "People are already seeing dramatic changes in weight after taking Rybelsus. One Reddit user from India shared his complete weight loss journey with Rybelsus. In his own words, Rybelsus, which was prescribed to him ‘off-label’, has worked wonders for him.",
        "He shares, “I have not done any exercise yet. I have not completely cut down on sugar either. It [Rybelsus] has really been a life changer for me since I have been struggling with my weight for a very long time. Just so you know, I was not diabetic or prediabetic before.”",
        "We know, you want to know, how much weight you can really lose safely and effectively with Rybelsus.",
        "It is tough to find out, as Rybelsus isn’t approved for weight loss in India.",
        "But you can surely find out how much weight you will lose with Aktive’s safe and clinically proven weight loss programme. Use our weight loss calculator below to know more.",
        "Our treatment plans have proven to result in 15% weight loss in one year. Curious as to how much you could lose?",
        "In India, Rybelsus is proving to be a game-changer. The country currently has 7.7 crore type 2 diabetics. The number will only continue to rise.",
        "As such, Rybelsus can turn the tables. The oral tablet can effectively control type 2 diabetes and help obese individuals reduce their weight in a non-invasive, safe, and sustainable manner.",
        "In fact, Indians are already warming up to Rybelsus for better glucose control and weight management.",
        "In an article published by the Economic Times in May 2024, Indian pharmaceutical analytics firm Pharmarack reported that Rybelsus sales in India ballooned from INR 47 crore a year in 2022 to INR 147 crore a year in 2023 to INR 363 crore in April 2024. Semaglutide currently holds a 66% share in the Indian anti-obesity market.",
        "This does hold up, as 22% of the male population in the country is overweight, 23% of the female population is overweight, and 11% of children in this country are overweight as well.",
        "Sheetal Sapale, Vice President - Commercial, Pharmarack, notes, “One in four adults falls in the overweight category. Almost 5% of the Indian population of 1.4 billion falls in the morbidly obese category.”",
        "Thus, it comes as no surprise that Indians are now relying on Rybelsus to combat obesity and diabetes.",
        "The question, however, still stands - Is Rybelsus really the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drug that will work for you?",

        "Now that you know when and how to take your Rybelsus tablet, it is also important to be aware about Rybelsus side effects.",

        "Eat a well-balanced diet. Eat foods that have lean protein, vitamins, and calcium. Try to eat as little processed foods, sugary drinks, and carbohydrates as possible.",
        "Try to exercise for at least two and a half hours every week. Take a small, brisk walk, jog around the park near your house, go for a swim, or take the bicycle out for a spin—do whatever you enjoy.",
        "Drink a lot of water throughout the day. Hydration is essential to tackle Rybelsus' side effects.",
        "If you are a type 2 diabetic, track your blood sugar levels on a regular basis while taking Rybelsus.",
        "Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night to stay fit and keep Rybelsus' side effects at bay.",
        "Stress is not good for the body. To reduce stress, try yoga, meditation, or relaxation techniques.",

        "Lean proteins:",
        "Non-starchy vegetables:",
        "Whole grains:",

        "Yes, Rybelsus is available in India. However, it is only approved for type 2 diabetes management.",
        "If you are looking for an effective weight loss treatment plan, look no further than Aktive. You can choose from the daily tablet plan and the 2-daily tablet plan to meet your weight loss goals quickly and safely.",
        "While Rybelsus is quite effective when it comes to type 2 diabetes management and weight loss, there are other alternatives to the oral tablet as well. Read the comparison table below to know more:",
        "Rybelsus is a revolutionary anti-diabetic pill that helps people lose weight as well. Just one tablet a day shows drastic results in under a year - giving hope to type 2 diabetics and obese individuals that it still isn’t too late to take a step towards a healthy future.",
        "How soon can I expect Rybelsus to start working?",
        "Rybelsus starts lowering blood sugar levels within 1-2 weeks of starting treatment. However, it may take 4-5 weeks (sometimes even longer) to see its full effect on blood sugar levels and weight loss. Remember, weight loss results may vary based on other factors like your diet, exercise routine, and overall lifestyle.",
        "How is Rybelsus different from Ozempic?",
        "Rybelsus and Ozempic both contain the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both medicines help manage type 2 diabetes. However, the difference lies in how they are administered. Rybelsus is taken as an oral tablet, while Ozempic is taken as a once-weekly injection under the skin.",
        "Why can’t Rybelsus be used for type 1 diabetes?",
        "Rybelsus isn’t suitable for type 1 diabetes because the medicine helps the body make more insulin. The tablet only works if your pancreas still has some cells that can produce insulin, which is not the case in type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetics need insulin injections rather than tablets because their body cannot make insulin at all.",
        "Does Rybelsus work differently for people of different ethnic backgrounds?",
        "Rybelsus has been tested on people from various ethnic backgrounds. Studies show it works similarly across different groups. However, individual responses can vary due to genetics, lifestyle, or other factors. It’s important to follow doctor’s advice based on your specific health needs to meet your weight loss goals with Rybelsus.",
        "What should I do if I don’t see results after starting Rybelsus?",
        "If you don’t see results after taking Rybelsus for several weeks or months, consult your doctor. They might adjust your dose, recommend lifestyle changes like diet or exercise, or suggest alternative treatment options. Don’t make changes to your medication without informing your doctor.",
        "Can I stop taking Rybelsus once my blood sugar is controlled or I’ve lost enough weight?",
        "Rybelsus helps manage type 2 diabetes and aids in weight loss, but these are ongoing conditions. Stopping the medication suddenly can cause your blood sugar spikes and may make you gain weight. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your treatment.",
        "Can I take a generic version of Rybelsus instead?",
        "Currently, a generic version of Rybelsus is not available because the medication is protected by patents. The tablet form of semaglutide is unique. Hence, generics cannot be made until the patent expires.",
        "Is Rybelsus available without a prescription?",
        "No, Rybelsus is a prescription-only medication. You need a valid prescription from a licensed doctor to purchase it from both local and online pharmacies.",
        "Can I buy Rybelsus online?",
        "Yes, you can buy Rybelsus from licensed online pharmacies, but you must have a prescription from a doctor. Always ensure the online pharmacy is licensed and reliable so that you don’t receive counterfeit products.",
        "How can I ensure I’m getting genuine Rybelsus from my pharmacy?",
        "To make sure you’re getting genuine Rybelsus, buy only from licensed pharmacies. The packaging must have a clear labeling, a batch number, and an expiration date.

In an interview with The Indian Express, Mahboobani says he can now, “walk an hour every day, squeeze in 15 minutes of exercise, snack on salads, have dinner by 7 pm and sleep by 10 pm.” This is the magic Rybelsus brings to life. But what exactly is Rybelsus? How does an oral tablet help people lose weight and manage their glucose levels? Isn’t this too good to be true? Read on to find your answer. What is Rybelsus? Rybelsus is the oral form of semaglutide. It is prescribed for type 2 diabetes management. The FDA approved it in 2019. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation approved Rybelsus in India in 2022 for managing type 2 diabetes. It is currently available in three dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg. Even though Rybelsus is approved to manage type 2 diabetes, since it helps people lose weight simultaneously, doctors do sometimes prescribe it ‘off-label’ for weight loss as well. How does Rybelsus work? Semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Rybelsus, is a GLP - 1 receptor agonist. Don’t let the phrase put you off. GLP-1 is a hormone that naturally occurs in our bodies. This is what it does in our body: How does GLP-1 work? Releases insulin GLP-1 hormone signals the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar levels rise. This moves sugar into the cells to generate energy. Slows digestion The hormone slows down the pace of the movement of food through the stomach. This results in feeling fuller for longer after eating. Reduces sugar production in the liver The hormone decreases sugar production in the liver when it is not required. Controls appetite GLP-1 also affects the areas of the brain that control appetite. As a result, you end up feeling less hungry. Semaglutide mimics this hormone in the body, eventually resulting in type 2 diabetes management and weight loss. Rybelsus works exactly the same way as semaglutide - it makes the pancreas release more insulin, stops the liver from producing too much sugar, signals the brain to eat less, and slows down gastric emptying. This simple function of the medicine has helped millions of people worldwide and in India become healthier versions of themselves within a year. Real people. Real results: Rybelsus success story People are already seeing dramatic changes in weight after taking Rybelsus. One Reddit user from India shared his complete weight loss journey with Rybelsus.

However, it may take 4-5 weeks (sometimes even longer) to see its full effect on blood sugar levels and weight loss. Remember, weight loss results may vary based on other factors like your diet, exercise routine, and overall lifestyle. How is Rybelsus different from Ozempic? Rybelsus and Ozempic both contain the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both medicines help manage type 2 diabetes. However, the difference lies in how they are administered. Rybelsus is taken as an oral tablet, while Ozempic is taken as a once-weekly injection under the skin. Why can’t Rybelsus be used for type 1 diabetes? Rybelsus isn’t suitable for type 1 diabetes because the medicine helps the body make more insulin. The tablet only works if your pancreas still has some cells that can produce insulin, which is not the case in type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetics need insulin injections rather than tablets because their body cannot make insulin at all. Does Rybelsus work differently for people of different ethnic backgrounds? Rybelsus has been tested on people from various ethnic backgrounds. Studies show it works similarly across different groups. However, individual responses can vary due to genetics, lifestyle, or other factors.

If you don’t see results after taking Rybelsus for several weeks or months, consult your doctor.

Can I stop taking Rybelsus once my blood sugar is controlled or I’ve lost enough weight? Rybelsus helps manage type 2 diabetes and aids in weight loss, but these are ongoing conditions. Stopping the medication suddenly can cause your blood sugar spikes and may make you gain weight. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your treatment. Can I take a generic version of Rybelsus instead? Currently, a generic version of Rybelsus is not available because the medication is protected by patents. The tablet form of semaglutide is unique. Hence, generics cannot be made until the patent expires. Is Rybelsus available without a prescription? No, Rybelsus is a prescription-only medication. You need a valid prescription from a licensed doctor to purchase it from both local and online pharmacies. Can I buy Rybelsus online? Yes, you can buy Rybelsus from licensed online pharmacies, but you must have a prescription from a doctor. Always ensure the online pharmacy is licensed and reliable so that you don’t receive counterfeit products. How can I ensure I’m getting genuine Rybelsus from my pharmacy?

        "Introducing GLP-1 medicines, a revolutionary path to successful and lasting weight loss. Available as daily tablets or weekly injections, scientists have found that what was once just a diabetes medication could in fact be a cure for obesity. Keep reading to learn about the science of GLP-1 and why the results are so effective.",
        "GLP-1 drugs refer to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, also known as GLP-1 analogues or incretin mimetics.",
        "You may have heard of brands like Wegovy ,Ozempic, or Rybelsus, made popular by Hollywood and Bollywood celebrities. These are GLP-1 treatments (containing Semaglutide) that can accelerate your weight loss journey by affecting your hunger levels and your metabolism.",
        "GLP-1 medicines must be used long-term, in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, in order to achieve maximum results. Many people choose to take them in tablet form so as to avoid self-injection and because it’s quick and easy. However, it is also possible to inject GLP-1 agonists once per week.",
        "Over time, you slowly increase the dosage level, giving your body plenty of time to adjust. Higher doses of GLP-1 offer greater weight loss results.",
        "Positive side effect diabetes",
        "Originally, GLP-1 agonists were created to treat diabetes. People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood, and GLP-1 drugs help by increasing incretin hormone levels that stimulate insulin production. Insulin is required to bring blood sugar levels down, by letting sugar become absorbed from the blood into nearby cells.",
        "Testing effect on digestion",
        "When testing the effect of GLP-1 agonists, it was also discovered that they reduced the rate of digestion and slowed down stomach emptying. This caused a decrease in appetite and led many trialled patients to lose weight.",
        "Approved for weight loss",
        "It wasn’t until many years of further testing that the first GLP-1 drug was approved for the treatment of weight loss in obese individuals. It has since worked to help thousands of people across the globe achieve their weight loss goals.",
        "GLP-1 drugs work to aid in weight loss by doing several different things. They work by:",
        "Suppressing your usual appetite:",
        "Your body naturally produces GLP-1 hormones (such as glucagon) in the small intestine. They are responsible for sending your brain the signal that you are full. GLP-1 drugs mimic these naturally occurring hormones by binding to the GLP-1 receptor hormones in the brain. This results in increased feelings of fullness.",
        "Slowing down gastric emptying:",

      "main_text": "What are GLP-1 medications? GLP-1 drugs refer to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, also known as GLP-1 analogues or incretin mimetics. You may have heard of brands like Wegovy , Ozempic , or Rybelsus , made popular by Hollywood and Bollywood celebrities. These are GLP-1 treatments (containing Semaglutide ) that can accelerate your weight loss journey by affecting your hunger levels and your metabolism. GLP-1 medicines must be used long-term, in conjunction with exercise and a sensible diet, in order to achieve maximum results. Many people choose to take them in tablet form so as to avoid self-injection and because it’s quick and easy. However, it is also possible to inject GLP-1 agonists once per week. Over time, you slowly increase the dosage level, giving your body plenty of time to adjust. Higher doses of GLP-1 offer greater weight loss results. The discovery of GLP-1 1987 Positive side effect diabetes Originally, GLP-1 agonists were created to treat diabetes. People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood, and GLP-1 drugs help by increasing incretin hormone levels that stimulate insulin production. Insulin is required to bring blood sugar levels down, by letting sugar become absorbed from the blood into nearby cells. 2000 Testing effect on digestion When testing the effect of GLP-1 agonists, it was also discovered that they reduced the rate of digestion and slowed down stomach emptying. This caused a decrease in appetite and led many trialled patients to lose weight. 2014 Approved for weight loss It wasn’t until many years of further testing that the first GLP-1 drug was approved for the treatment of weight loss in obese individuals. It has since worked to help thousands of people across the globe achieve their weight loss goals. The science of GLP-1: How does it work? GLP-1 drugs work to aid in weight loss by doing several different things. They work by: Suppressing your usual appetite: Your body naturally produces GLP-1 hormones (such as glucagon) in the small intestine. They are responsible for sending your brain the signal that you are full. GLP-1 drugs mimic these naturally occurring hormones by binding to the GLP-1 receptor hormones in the brain. This results in increased feelings of fullness. Slowing down gastric emptying: GLP-1 also acts on the stomach and slows down the rate at which it empties its contents into the small intestine. This delayed gastric emptying can help you feel full longer after eating, reducing the frequency of meals and snacks. Regulating blood sugar: GLP-1 drugs have a glucose-lowering effect by enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and inhibiting glucagon release. When blood sugar levels are better controlled, it can reduce cravings for high-calorie, sugary foods, which aids in successful weight loss. View programme Do I qualify? Is GLP-1 scientifically proven? GLP-1 treatments have been thoroughly researched and studied since they were released in the 2000s. One study taken on just under 2,000 obese people (with a BMI of 30 or above) showcases the effectiveness of the drug. It was a double-blind trial , meaning that neither the patients nor those conducting the study knew who was taking the GLP-1 treatment, and who was using a placebo. The trial took place over 68 weeks. Results found that: Over 68 weeks of regularly taking GLP-1 (Semaglutide), the mean change in body weight was -14.8% . In contrast to this, people who were taking a placebo drug (and relied on lifestyle changes alone) had a mean change in body weight of -2.4% . In kilos, on average: The Semaglutide group lost 15.3 kg The placebo group lost 2.6kg Patients taking Semaglutide lost significantly more weight than those taking the placebo drug - up to 15% of their original body weight. Tablets vs injections Semaglutide is available in the form of daily tablets or weekly injections. The type of treatment you use is usually down to preference. The following table outlines the key differences between these two types of GLP-1: Tablets Injections Taken once daily Available doses: 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg Must be taken on an empty stomach Tablets are quick and easy to take Taken once weekly Available doses: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.7 mg, 2.4 mg Can be taken at any point during the day Injections take a little longer to be administered View programme How long does it take to start working? GLP-1 treatments are not a quick fix. In order for weight loss to be healthy and sustainable, it needs to be slow and steady. There is no miracle cure that will make you lose weight overnight. That being said, you’re likely to start noticing results after the first couple of months of treatment. You know your body best, so you’ll be the first to notice that your clothes are slightly looser, or that parts of your body have decreased in size. More significant weight loss takes place when you’ve been on treatment for at least six months.

Once you reach the maximum maintenance dose, you’ll notice that you’re progressing faster than ever in your journey towards better health. Taking higher doses means that there’s more of the treatment in your system. More GLP-1 means less appetite and fewer calories consumed, which means more weight loss. Importance of doses Semaglutide is available in different doses: It is critical that anyone who starts taking GLP-1 treatment begins on the lowest possible starting dose. Your body needs time to adjust to a new medication - beginning on a higher dose comes with risks. Every four weeks you can increase your dose to the next level up. Your body needs ample time to adjust to the treatment so as to limit your chances of side effects. It’s very important not to increase your dose sooner, or to skip dosage levels. In this case, your body will not respond as it should. You’ll likely suffer from adverse gastric side effects that may disrupt your progress or put a halt to your weight loss journey altogether. What are the benefits? The main benefits of taking GLP-1 medication are weight loss and lower blood glucose levels. Weight loss itself has multiple health benefits, including a lowered risk of : heart disease and heart failure stroke kidney disease type 2 diabetes some forms of cancer musculoskeletal disorders Many of these conditions can become life-threatening. By aiding in successful weight loss, GLP-1 treatments can improve your long-term health and reduce your chances of developing serious weight-related health conditions. View programme How you can make the most out of GLP-1 While taking GLP-1 is the first step towards achieving your weight loss goals, you do need to implement certain diet and lifestyle changes in order to get the most out of your treatment. Healthy food It’s important to focus on choosing healthy foods in order to gain the required nutrients from your diet. Eating three chocolate bars a day won't suffice, even if you’re remaining in a calorie deficit. Foods to choose Foods to avoid Lean protein sources (chicken, tofu, lean mince, greek yoghurt, cottage cheese) Wholegrains (brown rice over white) Healthy fats (olive oil, avocados, fatty fish) Vegetables, including dark leafy greens Alcohol (high in sugar) Fast food or greasy takeaways White, processed carbohydrates (white rice or bread) High sugar foods Fatty, highly processed meats like salami and bacon Exercise Doing exercise on a regular basis will also help you get the most out of your treatment. We recommend that you do roughly 30 minutes of cardio or weight training two to three times per week. Feel free to start slower and gradually build your fitness levels up. What if it doesn’t work? GLP-1 drugs work effectively for the majority of people who use them. However, there are always exceptions.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar) Some lesser-known millet health benefits Before we jump into how millets make us healthier, let us have a look at the nutritional value of small-grained cereals. Nutritional value of millets So, what makes millets so nutritious [1] ? Check out the label below: In addition, millets are also dense in antioxidants (polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins), heart-healthy compounds (phytosterols & policosanols), gut-friendly fibre (prebiotics & resistant starch), and slow-digesting starch (β-glucans & arabinoxylans). What does this mean for our health? Millets are superfoods. No doubt, they will have several benefits for physical health and even mental wellbeing. In one study [2] , primary school children in India were given multi-millet health mixes, which included kodo millet ( kodon ), little millet ( kutki ), foxtail millet ( kangni ), and finger millet ( ragi ) along with pulses. It had the following effect: The children gained weight. Their malnutrition levels improved. The children’s growth did not remain stunted. A randomised clinical trial [3] made adolescent girls eat bajra laddoos regularly. It increased the haemoglobin levels in the girls’ blood significantly. 16 lesser-known millet health benefits Millets are not just a regular source of fibre and protein. Its benefits go beyond just your diet. The Nutricereals are known to manage lifestyle diseases and combat several illnesses as well. Millets are a great food choice for type 2 diabetic patients. Eating a millet-based diet: Improves glycemic control [4] helps the body produce less insulin [4] Reduces kidney disease risk [5] decreases post-prandial glucose levels [6] and HbA1C levels [7] Millets are also good at: Preventing cholesterol synthesis in the body. Reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Preventing carcinogenesis [8] , i.e. stopping normal cells from turning into cancer cells. Helping with better digestion and regular bowel movements [9] . Managing blood pressure levels. Apart from this, millets help manage: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Gastric ulcers Celiac disease Gluten insensitivity Alzheimer’s disease Parkison’s disease Are there any side effects of eating millets? Even superfoods like millets come with their small share of downsides. They include: Bloating, gas, cramping, and irregular motions. Abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Slowed down iron absorption. Constipation, if eaten in excess. Dehydration, if not well hydrated. Run of the mill? Not anymore… Millets were superfoods before superfoods were even a thing. These grains are a storehouse of fibre, essential nutrients, and slow-digesting carbohydrates. A perfect gluten-free grain, an easy, environmentally friendly alternative to rice, and an ideal food choice for weight loss, millets are here to help you seize the day. Want to maximise the benefits of millets? Try millet rotis instead of whole wheat rotis Swap regular porridge with ragi porridge Eat millet khichdi in place of the usual one.

Eating healthy is just one facet of weight loss. A weight loss approach that works for one person may not always work for the other. Aktive uses scientifically proven and doctor-backed weight loss plans, so you can shed the extra weight without breaking a sweat. So, what are you waiting for? FAQs Which millet is the healthiest? The healthiest millet can be decided based on what specific need it serves. If it is for bone health, finger millet ( ragi ) is the best choice as it is a rich source of calcium. If you need more protein, foxtail ( kangni ) and proso millets ( chena ) are there to help. If you wish to add more fibre, browntop ( choti kangni ) and barnyard millets ( sawan ) will keep your gut functioning like a well-oiled engine. If iron supplementation is your goal, then barnyard millet ( sawan ) is the way to go. Ultimately, all millets are healthy. When eaten as a part of a balanced diet, they certainly have a lot to offer. How do millets compare nutritionally to other grains like rice and wheat? Nutrition-wise, millets certainly offer more than wheat and rice. They have: 12-16% protein, which is higher than rice (6–8%) and wheat (8–12%). 11-14% fibre, whereas rice (white, polished) has only 0.2-0.8% of it. A lower glycemic index (approx. 52-68), compared to rice (73–89) and wheat (70–75). Very little to no gluten, which makes them a better grain choice for people with celiac disease and gluten intolerance. More vitamins like niacin (B3), folate, and vitamin E. More minerals like: Calcium. Iron. Magnesium and zinc. This makes millets the better choice of grains for fulfilling our nutritional needs and managing weight. Are millets suitable for people with gluten intolerance? Yes. Being gluten-free, millets are an excellent choice of grains for people troubled with celiac disease or gluten intolerance (non-celiac gluten sensitivity). You can enjoy eating millet as rotis , khichdi , dosa/idli , upma or porridge, and not worry about the effects of gluten intolerance. Should millets be stored to maintain their freshness? To ensure your millets stay fresh, you can try the following: Clean the millets and dry them in the sun for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can dry roast them. Some suggest coating your hands lightly with some castor or mustard oil and rubbing the millets in your palms. Soak them in water before you cook as this will remove that oil coating. Always store millets in a clean, airtight container. Keep them in a cool, dry place, preferably away from direct sunlight. Vacuum-sealed bags are a good option if you have to store millets in bulk. Refrigerate or freeze them, especially if you stay in a humid environment. Can children consume millets safely? Absolutely. Millets are a storehouse of nutrients and their addition to the diet (in moderate amounts) ensures children remain physically and mentally healthy. Finger millet ( ragi ) provides calcium for strong bones, teeth, and muscles. Foxtail millet ( kangni ) and little millet ( kutki ) are gut-friendly and light on the stomach. The protein content in amaranth ( rajgira ) is essential to ensure good physical growth. You can introduce children to millets by preparing millet porridge, pancakes, or dosa for them. Which millet can be eaten everyday? Millets are highly nutritious and versatile and can be eaten everyday. However, it is best to consume them in small amounts first and gradually increase their intake as every person's digestive system may respond differently to them. Some millets that can be eaten everyday include: Pearl Millet ( bajra ) Finger millet ( ragi ) Foxtail millet ( kangni ) Proso millet ( chena ) Barnyard millet ( sawan ) Are there any specific dietary restrictions that millets cater to? Millets are indeed an advantage for individuals who have dietary restrictions such as: Celiac disease. Gluten intolerance. Lactose intolerance. Vegans. Diabetes. What is the best way to cook millets? Follow these steps to cook millets and get the most out of them: Always rinse thoroughly to remove debris. Soak them for 30 minutes to 5 hours as this will reduce the cooking time. For every 1 cup of millet, use 2.5 cups of water to cook it. This millet-to-water ratio can be higher if you are making porridge or khichdi. Cook millets on high heat first, and then simmer. This will prevent a mushy consistency. You can use pressure cooking to accelerate the cooking time. As millets are gluten-free, xanthan gum (1 tsp per cup) or psyllium husk can be used for binding the flour while making rotis. Add rice or tapioca flour to millet rotis for better texture. How can I prepare millets in a healthy way? Here are some tips you can try: Soaking millets for some hours (or overnight) will lower the anti-nutrients and increase their absorption in the body. Sprouting them increases the availability of proteins and vitamins. Eat them with vegetables and other protein sources for a balanced meal. Rotate different millets for more health benefits.

        "The real game-changer.",
        "This guide focuses on making small, manageable changes, such as eating healthily, walking more, or learning to stop eating when you feel full.",
        "If you’re just getting started with Wegovy (or wondering how to achieve better results), here are a 5 best lifestyle changes that can make a difference.",
        "Even if your appetite has reduced, your food choices still play a big role in how your body responds. Taking Wegovy doesn't mean giving up on your favourite foods. You just need to make simple changes.",
        "The trick here is to focus on your hunger cues rather than eating out of habit or schedule.",
        "We know that staying physically active is always a positive for our overall health.",
        "Studies[1] have shown that combining Wegovy with regular exercise leads to greater weight loss, reduces belly fat, and improves blood sugar, blood pressure, and energy levels better than using Wegovy or exercise alone.",
        "Experts recommend doing up to five hours of moderate-intensity exercise[2] every week.",
        "Staying hydrated is a simple yet very underrated way to reduce side effects and improve your results with Wegovy.",

        "You can burn calories throughout the day by engaging in calorie-restricted exercise. However, rest and recovery also play a significant role in weight loss.",
        "According to a study,[3] poor-quality sleep can lead to increased fat gain and muscle loss.",
        "In times of stress, it is easy to turn to food for comfort. Sweets, fried snacks, or mindless munching can undo all your hard work.",

        "Wegovy is a prescription medication, and your doctor plays a crucial role in your success with it. Here’s when you should check in with your doctor:",
        "Following up with your doctor regularly ensures that your body is responding to the medication as expected.",
        "Weight loss medications like Wegovy are like tools that assist weight loss. But it is your habits that will keep the momentum going. Your food choices, exercise, and self-care are more important than anything in achieving weight loss success.",
        "Making lifestyle changes doesn\"t have to be a solo mission.",
        "Get your family involved, whether it's for evening walks, cooking together, or simply supporting your choices.",

        "Can I drink alcohol while taking Wegovy?",
        "Although there’s no known chemical interaction between Wegovy and alcohol, doctors generally recommend limiting or avoiding alcohol intake.",
        "Alcohol tends to dehydrate, which can add to Wegovy's side effects like nausea, dizziness, headache, or fatigue.",
        "Will Wegovy still work if I don’t exercise?",
        "Yes, Wegovy will still be effective even if you don’t exercise.",

But if you're hoping for long-term results, you need something more powerful than the medication - you. The real game-changer. In this article: Key takeaways: 1. Eat balanced meals on Wegovy 2. Exercise to enhance Wegovy’s effectiveness 3. Don’t forget to hydrate 4. Sleep well to lose weight on Wegovy 5. Don’t stress yourself while on Wegovy To conclude Key takeaways: Wegovy is a groundbreaking medication used for managing weight loss and type 2 diabetes. It works best with healthy eating, regular exercise, stress management, and good sleep. Setbacks will happen. What matters is showing up for your better health. This guide focuses on making small, manageable changes, such as eating healthily, walking more, or learning to stop eating when you feel full. If you’re just getting started with Wegovy (or wondering how to achieve better results), here are a 5 best lifestyle changes that can make a difference. Lifestyle changes to make while taking Wegovy Eat a balanced diet Exercise regularly Hydrate yourself Sleep well Minimise stress 1. Eat balanced meals on Wegovy Even if your appetite has reduced, your food choices still play a big role in how your body responds. Taking Wegovy doesn't mean giving up on your favourite foods. You just need to make simple changes. The trick here is to focus on your hunger cues rather than eating out of habit or schedule. Here’s how you can do that: Have smaller meals throughout the day, rather than large meals all at once. Have light dinners, such as vegetable-rich soups or khichdi made from rice or millets. Ensure your meal portions are adequate, neither too much nor too little. For snacking, eat nuts, seeds, makhanas , and fruits instead of chips or fried foods. Try using fewer seed oils and processed foods. Substitute refined carbohydrate sources with complex ones (for example, replace wheat rotis with millet rotis ). Reduce your salt intake. Add herbs, spices, or citrus zest to your food for flavour. Do not give in to the pressure of eating more just to be polite. You can always say NO politely. 2. Exercise to enhance Wegovy’s effectiveness We know that staying physically active is always a positive for our overall health. Studies [1] have shown that combining Wegovy with regular exercise leads to greater weight loss, reduces belly fat, and improves blood sugar, blood pressure, and energy levels better than using Wegovy or exercise alone. Experts recommend doing up to five hours of moderate-intensity exercise [2] every week. How to begin: Walk regularly. You can start by walking around your block or in the local park for 10-15 minutes at regular intervals. Want more ideas? Check out this list of 10 easy at-home exercises for weight loss . Try activities such as light jogging, swimming, and yoga to enhance insulin sensitivity. Add strength training to your routine with small weights, dumbbells, resistance bands, or bodyweight. Combine various yoga poses to enhance your balance and posture. To start, here are 5 yoga poses that can help. Add a little zing to your workouts with music, friends, and doing something different every day. 3. Don’t forget to hydrate Staying hydrated is a simple yet very underrated way to reduce side effects and improve your results with Wegovy. Drinking water helps: Control your cravings. Eat within limits. Reduce bloating and constipation. Manage changes in blood sugar levels. Here’s what you can do for better hydration: Sip water throughout the day, especially before meals. If you are tired of plain water, try drinks like jeera water, lemon-cucumber infusions, or herbal tea. In fact, jeera water helps with weight loss too. Eat foods with high water content, such as cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and ice apples. Avoid drinking sugary beverages or packaged fruit juices. Hydrating yourself well can help you minimise nausea, which is a common Wegovy side effect. Learn more about managing Wegovy side effects . 4. Sleep well to lose weight on Wegovy You can burn calories throughout the day by engaging in calorie-restricted exercise. However, rest and recovery also play a significant role in weight loss. According to a study , [3] poor-quality sleep can lead to increased fat gain and muscle loss. Keep a gap of at least 2 hours between your last meal and bedtime. Aim for at least 7 hours of quality sleep each night. Try guided meditation or white noise to help you fall asleep faster. Avoid screens before bed. Blue light from phones and TVs can interfere with your sleep. You can light a soothing, scented candle to create a calm and restful atmosphere. 5. Don’t stress yourself while on Wegovy In times of stress, it is easy to turn to food for comfort. Sweets, fried snacks, or mindless munching can undo all your hard work. That’s because stress pushes up your cortisol levels [4] , a hormone that makes your body crave high-fat, high-sugar foods. Here’s how to stay away from stress: Stay patient. Weight loss takes time and consistency. A slow week doesn’t mean failure. You can always bounce back. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. Don’t forget to treat yourself occasionally. Make time to relax. Deep breathing, a walk, or light stretching - anything that calms you down is good. Be kind to yourself. Progress comes with ups and downs, and that’s okay. Feeling tempted to grab that sweet cookie? Your cravings might be a sign of a deeper issue. Learn how to control your food cravings and stay on track. Important note Wegovy is a prescription medication, and your doctor plays a crucial role in your success with it. Here’s when you should check in with your doctor: Visit your doctor in case of the following: Persistent side effects like nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Fluctuating blood sugar levels. The medication is taking time to show results. You are planning to switch to another medication, like Mounjaro. Following up with your doctor regularly ensures that your body is responding to the medication as expected. To conclude Weight loss medications like Wegovy are like tools that assist weight loss. But it is your habits that will keep the momentum going. Your food choices, exercise, and self-care are more important than anything in achieving weight loss success. Making lifestyle changes doesn\"t have to be a solo mission. Get your family involved, whether it's for evening walks, cooking together, or simply supporting your choices. So be patient with your body. Give your habits time to settle. And if things feel slow, that’s okay. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Learn more about Wegovy FAQs Can I drink alcohol while taking Wegovy? Although there’s no known chemical interaction between Wegovy and alcohol, doctors generally recommend limiting or avoiding alcohol intake. Alcohol tends to dehydrate, which can add to Wegovy's side effects like nausea, dizziness, headache, or fatigue. Will Wegovy still work if I don’t exercise?

        "This guide will help you understand how the Wegovy dosage schedule works, why going slow is better, and when (or if) it’s time to move up.",
        "Developed by Novo Nordisk, Wegovy is a once-weekly injection designed to help you lose weight. Its active ingredient, Semaglutide[1], mimics the action of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone, which plays an important part in controlling appetite and managing insulin levels.",
        "What this means is:",
        "Wegovy was approved in India in June 2025 for chronic weight management in people who are overweight or obese. Unlike daily pills or strict diets, it’s taken as a once-weekly injection, which makes it more manageable for many people.",

        "You will begin taking Wegovy at its lowest dosage - 0.25 mg.",
        "Your dosage will be increased every month.",
        "This gradual increase helps your body adjust to the medicine.",
        "As you progress, your doctor will decide how long to keep you on a particular dose based on how well you are doing.",
        "Here is a typical dosing schedule doctors usually follow:",
        "Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice.",
        "Here’s what you can expect to see in the coming weeks when you start taking Wegovy:",
        "Although 2.4 mg is the maximum dose for Wegovy, many respond well at a lower dose. Your dose may be maintained or escalated based on clinical results and your comfort level.",
        "Your weight isn't the only factor that decides how much Wegovy you need. When prescribing Wegovy, doctors also evaluate the following things:",
        "The reason behind doing so is to find the lowest effective dose so that you can lose weight without feeling worse. Some people stay on a lower dose long-term, and that’s perfectly okay.",
        "In case you miss your dose, do the following:",
        "Less than 2 days (48 hours) away:",
        "Don't take the missed dose. Take your next dose on your regular scheduled day. Do not take a double dose to make up for the lost one.",
        "More than 2 days (48 hours) away:",
        "Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.",
        "More than 2 weeks (14 days) have passed:",
        "Wait for your usual injection day, or check with your doctor before restarting. They’ll guide you on whether to continue or adjust your schedule.",
        "In case you need to change your injection day, make sure there’s a gap of at least two days between doses.",
        "Since Wegovy works by altering your gut hormones, appetite, and insulin response, it can cause some unwanted effects.",
        "Nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, and vomiting are among the most common side effects of Wegovy.",
        "You’ll likely feel side effects of Wegovy early on or when your dose increases. But most of them are mild and disappear with time as your body adjusts to the medicine",
        "It can take some time to get used to a medication, especially one that affects your appetite and blood sugar levels. But with these small changes, you can adapt to the new dose better:",
        "Your doctor may advise to pause, delay, or reduce your Wegovy dose in the following situations:",
        "If you’re unsure about a side effect, missed a dose, or are planning surgery, fasting, or pregnancy, talk to your doctor first before you make a decision.",
        "Use a diary or a tracking app to record your daily weight, mood, energy levels, and any symptoms you experience. These records can help your doctor adjust your dose.",
        "Everyone experiences weight loss differently. Some people see visible weight loss at a lower dose, while others may need to use the highest dose of Wegovy. What's important is that your body tolerates the dose safely and shows results.",
        "With the right support and a little patience, you can see progress beyond the weighing scale.",
        "Launched in India in June 2025",
        "Wegovy is available in India in the form of a pre-filled injection pen (FlexTouch). You can either self-inject it or take it with the help of a healthcare professional.",
        "Can I increase my Wegovy dose faster if I'm not experiencing any side effects?",
        "Even if you feel completely fine, don’t skip ahead. Each 4-week stage is designed to help your body’s GLP-1 receptors adapt slowly and safely. Rushing doses can trigger sudden side effects or reduce how well the treatment works later.",
        "Will I regain weight if I stop Wegovy after reaching my goal?",
        "Yes, there is a risk of weight regain[2] if lifestyle habits aren’t in place. But with the right guidance, gradual dose reduction, and adequate lifestyle + diet changes, it’s absolutely possible to maintain your progress, even without staying on the highest dose forever.",
        "Can my doctor customize my dose schedule differently from the standard plan?",
        "Yes. The standard Wegovy dosage schedule is a general guideline. It is flexible to an extent, and your doctor may adjust it based on your current health and how your body responds to the medication.",
        "For instance, someone might remain at 0.5 mg for 8 weeks, while another patient may stabilise at 1.0 mg for maintenance. Trust your doctor’s judgment. They’ll adjust your dose to keep it both safe and effective for you.",
        "What if I feel nothing after the first few doses of Wegovy?",
        "Don’t worry, this is normal. The initial 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg doses are meant to help your body adjust. Most people notice effects like appetite control or weight loss from 1.0 mg onwards. Your doctor will guide the pace.",
        "Why do side effects come back each time I increase the dose?",
        "This is completely normal. With every dose increase, your body is introduced to a higher level of Semaglutide, so it needs time to settle again. It’s common to experience mild nausea, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits for 3-10 days before they subside.",
        "These symptoms tend to settle on their own as your body gets used to the new level. That’s exactly why the dose increases are spaced out to help you adapt gradually",
        "I'm losing weight well on 1.0 mg. Do I still need to increase to higher doses?",
        "Not always. If you’re losing weight steadily, tolerating the 1.0 mg dose well, and are happy with your progress, your doctor might choose to keep you there. The idea is to find the smallest dose that still helps you progress.",
        "Can I go back to a lower dose if the side effects become too uncomfortable?",
        "Yes, it’s possible. If you experience ongoing nausea, vomiting, or other strong side effects after moving up to a higher dose, your doctor might bring you back to a lower dose for a few more weeks.",
        "Sometimes, staying at a lower dose for some weeks helps your body adjust before switching to a higher dose. And for some people, that’s the right long-term dose.",
        "Just don’t adjust your dose on your own. Always check with your doctor first.",
        "Why does the schedule require 4 weeks at each dose level? Can this timing be adjusted?",
        "The 4-week gap is there for a reason. It lets your body adjust to the new dose and prevents side effects. Still, it’s not a one-size-fits-all rule. If you're struggling with side effects, your doctor may keep you at the same dose for 6–8 weeks instead.",
        "I've missed 3 weeks of Wegovy. Do I need to restart from 0.25 mg?",
        "Not always. Resuming your previous dose can be slightly tricky. After a gap of more than two weeks, your body loses some of its tolerance to the medicine. Your doctor will usually restart you at a slightly lower dose, and bring you back up to a higher dose gradually.",
        "The ramp-up will be quicker this time, but still under your doctor’s supervision. Never restart on your own.",
        "What should I do if I accidentally inject a higher dose than prescribed?",
        "If this happens, even if you don't feel any symptoms right now, let your doctor know immediately.",
        "Accidentally injecting a higher dose, such as 1.0mg instead of 0.5mg, can trigger intense nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or low blood sugar.",
        "Keep monitoring how you feel, and don’t take your next scheduled dose until your doctor advises. They’ll guide you on the safest way to restart.",
        "Can I stay on the starting dose of 0.25 mg if I see good results?",
        "Though 0.25 mg is technically a treatment dose, it is intended as a starting point to help you adjust. It keeps side effects low while your system learns to handle the medicine.",
        "If you’re already seeing results on 0.25 mg, that’s good, but the progress may not last. Your doctor will likely guide you to increase the dose gradually so you get better results.",
        "My weight loss has plateaued at my current dose. Should I ask my doctor to increase the dose?",
        "Not necessarily. Weight loss plateaus are common and happen for a few reasons:",
        "Before increasing your dose, your doctor will look at:",
        "In many cases, small lifestyle adjustments work better than dose changes. Your doctor will guide you based on your current health status.",
        "Do all patients have to reach the maintenance dose of Wegovy?",
        "Not necessarily. While 2.4 mg is the full maintenance dose, not everyone may need to take it. Some people may see good results at a lower dose (this is especially true if they experience side effects at higher levels). Your doctor will help you find the dose that works best for your body.",

Managing side effects as your dose increases Tips to make dose escalation easier When to pause or reduce your Wegovy dose? Weight loss at your dose, your pace Key takeaways: Wegovy is a once-weekly injection approved in India for managing obesity. It is available in 5 dose strengths: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg. Increasing the dose gradually helps tolerate the medicine and lose weight. Wegovy is available in five different doses. But, why is that? Titrating, adjusting the dose, too quickly can result in intense side effects and might make you discontinue the medicine. This guide will help you understand how the Wegovy dosage schedule works, why going slow is better, and when (or if) it’s time to move up. What is Wegovy? How does it work? Developed by Novo Nordisk, Wegovy is a once-weekly injection designed to help you lose weight. Its active ingredient, Semaglutide [1] , mimics the action of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone, which plays an important part in controlling appetite and managing insulin levels. What this means is: It acts on areas of your brain that control appetite, so you feel full and eat less. It slows down how quickly food leaves your stomach. It helps regulate blood sugar levels. Wegovy was approved in India in June 2025 for chronic weight management in people who are overweight or obese. Unlike daily pills or strict diets, it’s taken as a once-weekly injection, which makes it more manageable for many people. Like Wegovy, another medication known as Mounjaro works by mimicking not just GLP-1, but also GIP for better results. See how Mounjaro helps you lose weight .

This gradual increase helps your body adjust to the medicine. As you progress, your doctor will decide how long to keep you on a particular dose based on how well you are doing. Here is a typical dosing schedule doctors usually follow: Wegovy dosage schedule Dose (mg/week) Frequency Duration Purpose What you’ll notice 0.25 mg Once weekly Weeks 1–4 Starting dose to help your body adjust to Wegovy Your appetite begins to reduce 0.5 mg Once weekly Weeks 5–8 Helps build tolerance to side effects and minimises them Mild side effects like nausea begin to settle. You crave less food 1.0 mg Once weekly Weeks 9–12 Supports gradual weight loss progression You begin to feel full faster than before, calorie intake reduces, and you begin to lose weight 1.7 mg Once weekly Weeks 13–16 Common maintenance dose for long-term use Your weight loss continues and energy levels start to improve 2.4 mg Once weekly Week 17 onwards (if required) For patients who need a higher dose after 1.7 mg You have lost a good amount of weight, and you feel more in control of your life Please note that the actual plan may vary based on your doctor's advice. Here’s what you can expect to see in the coming weeks when you start taking Wegovy: Weeks 1–4: Semaglutide is gently introduced into your system. Weeks 5–8: Your body gets used to the medicine. Weeks 9–12: You feel less hungry, eat less calories, and notice changes in weight. Weeks 13–16: You continue losing weight. Week 17 onwards: You are on the maintenance dose. You feel more energised and healthy. Note: Although 2.4 mg is the maximum dose for Wegovy, many respond well at a lower dose. Your dose may be maintained or escalated based on clinical results and your comfort level. How do doctors decide which dose is right for you? Your weight isn't the only factor that decides how much Wegovy you need. When prescribing Wegovy, doctors also evaluate the following things: Side effects – Are you tolerating the current dose well, or is it causing discomfort? Medical history – If you have diabetes, kidney or liver issues, or are on any medications. Blood sugar response – Especially in people with type 2 diabetes. Your personal weight loss goals – What you’re hoping to achieve and how your body responds. The reason behind doing so is to find the lowest effective dose so that you can lose weight without feeling worse. Some people stay on a lower dose long-term, and that’s perfectly okay. What to do if you miss a dose? In case you miss your dose, do the following: Less than 2 days (48 hours) away: Don't take the missed dose. Take your next dose on your regular scheduled day. Do not take a double dose to make up for the lost one. More than 2 days (48 hours) away: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. More than 2 weeks (14 days) have passed: Wait for your usual injection day, or check with your doctor before restarting. They’ll guide you on whether to continue or adjust your schedule. In case you need to change your injection day, make sure there’s a gap of at least two days between doses. Managing side effects as your dose increases Since Wegovy works by altering your gut hormones, appetite, and insulin response, it can cause some unwanted effects. Nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, and vomiting are among the most common side effects of Wegovy. You’ll likely feel side effects of Wegovy early on or when your dose increases. But most of them are mild and disappear with time as your body adjusts to the medicine Tips to make dose escalation easier It can take some time to get used to a medication, especially one that affects your appetite and blood sugar levels. But with these small changes , you can adapt to the new dose better: Eat light meals and chew food slowly for the first few days after starting Wegovy. Drink enough water throughout the day. Set reminders if you forget to hydrate. Take a walk, do some yoga, or try some gentle body stretches to manage nausea. Avoid eating spicy or fatty food immediately after injecting yourself. Always keep emergency contacts readily accessible if you experience an allergic reaction. When to pause or reduce your Wegovy dose? Your doctor may advise to pause, delay, or reduce your Wegovy dose in the following situations: If you are experiencing severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or stomach pain. If you missed multiple doses of Wegovy. If you are pregnant or are planning to conceive. If vomiting or diarrhoea dehydrates you. If you are undergoing a procedure that requires general anaesthesia or fasting. If you have conditions that affect liver or kidney function. If you are struggling to tolerate your current dose. If you’re unsure about a side effect, missed a dose, or are planning surgery, fasting, or pregnancy, talk to your doctor first before you make a decision. Pro tip Use a diary or a tracking app to record your daily weight, mood, energy levels, and any symptoms you experience. These records can help your doctor adjust your dose. Weight loss at your dose, your pace Everyone experiences weight loss differently. Some people see visible weight loss at a lower dose, while others may need to use the highest dose of Wegovy. What's important is that your body tolerates the dose safely and shows results. With the right support and a little patience, you can see progress beyond the weighing scale. Launched in India in June 2025 Wegovy is available in India in the form of a pre-filled injection pen (FlexTouch). You can either self-inject it or take it with the help of a healthcare professional. Read more about Wegovy FAQs Can I increase my Wegovy dose faster if I'm not experiencing any side effects? Even if you feel completely fine, don’t skip ahead. Each 4-week stage is designed to help your body’s GLP-1 receptors adapt slowly and safely. Rushing doses can trigger sudden side effects or reduce how well the treatment works later. Will I regain weight if I stop Wegovy after reaching my goal? Yes, there is a risk of weight regain [2] if lifestyle habits aren’t in place. But with the right guidance, gradual dose reduction, and adequate lifestyle + diet changes, it’s absolutely possible to maintain your progress, even without staying on the highest dose forever. Can my doctor customize my dose schedule differently from the standard plan? Yes. The standard Wegovy dosage schedule is a general guideline. It is flexible to an extent, and your doctor may adjust it based on your current health and how your body responds to the medication. For instance, someone might remain at 0.5 mg for 8 weeks, while another patient may stabilise at 1.0 mg for maintenance. Trust your doctor’s judgment. They’ll adjust your dose to keep it both safe and effective for you. What if I feel nothing after the first few doses of Wegovy? Don’t worry, this is normal. The initial 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg doses are meant to help your body adjust. Most people notice effects like appetite control or weight loss from 1.0 mg onwards. Your doctor will guide the pace. Why do side effects come back each time I increase the dose? This is completely normal. With every dose increase, your body is introduced to a higher level of Semaglutide, so it needs time to settle again. It’s common to experience mild nausea, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits for 3-10 days before they subside. These symptoms tend to settle on their own as your body gets used to the new level. That’s exactly why the dose increases are spaced out to help you adapt gradually I'm losing weight well on 1.0 mg. Do I still need to increase to higher doses? Not always. If you’re losing weight steadily, tolerating the 1.0 mg dose well, and are happy with your progress, your doctor might choose to keep you there. The idea is to find the smallest dose that still helps you progress. Can I go back to a lower dose if the side effects become too uncomfortable? Yes, it’s possible. If you experience ongoing nausea, vomiting, or other strong side effects after moving up to a higher dose, your doctor might bring you back to a lower dose for a few more weeks. Sometimes, staying at a lower dose for some weeks helps your body adjust before switching to a higher dose. And for some people, that’s the right long-term dose. Just don’t adjust your dose on your own. Always check with your doctor first. Why does the schedule require 4 weeks at each dose level? Can this timing be adjusted? The 4-week gap is there for a reason. It lets your body adjust to the new dose and prevents side effects. Still, it’s not a one-size-fits-all rule. If you're struggling with side effects, your doctor may keep you at the same dose for 6–8 weeks instead. I've missed 3 weeks of Wegovy. Do I need to restart from 0.25 mg? Not always. Resuming your previous dose can be slightly tricky. After a gap of more than two weeks, your body loses some of its tolerance to the medicine. Your doctor will usually restart you at a slightly lower dose, and bring you back up to a higher dose gradually. The ramp-up will be quicker this time, but still under your doctor’s supervision. Never restart on your own. What should I do if I accidentally inject a higher dose than prescribed? If this happens, even if you don't feel any symptoms right now, let your doctor know immediately. Accidentally injecting a higher dose, such as 1.0mg instead of 0.5mg, can trigger intense nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or low blood sugar. Keep monitoring how you feel, and don’t take your next scheduled dose until your doctor advises. They’ll guide you on the safest way to restart. Can I stay on the starting dose of 0.25 mg if I see good results? Though 0.25 mg is technically a treatment dose, it is intended as a starting point to help you adjust. It keeps side effects low while your system learns to handle the medicine. If you’re already seeing results on 0.25 mg, that’s good, but the progress may not last. Your doctor will likely guide you to increase the dose gradually so you get better results. My weight loss has plateaued at my current dose. Should I ask my doctor to increase the dose? Not necessarily. Weight loss plateaus are common and happen for a few reasons: Your body is adjusting to a new metabolic set point. Metabolism slows down to compensate for the lost weight. To keep up with changing eating habits and activities. Before increasing your dose, your doctor will look at: How much weight you’ve lost so far. Your tolerance to the medicine. In many cases, small lifestyle adjustments work better than dose changes. Your doctor will guide you based on your current health status. Do all patients have to reach the maintenance dose of Wegovy? Not necessarily. While 2.4 mg is the full maintenance dose, not everyone may need to take it. Some people may see good results at a lower dose (this is especially true if they experience side effects at higher levels). Your doctor will help you find the dose that works best for your body.

        "But, as with every other medicine, it is important to note that Wegovy is not a miracle drug that can replace a healthy diet and adequate physical activity for a healthier body. It sure is a means to the end, but it isn’t the end itself.",

        "Can I change the day or time to take Wegovy injection?",
        "It is recommended that you take the Wegovy injection on the same day and at the same time every week. However, if you would like to change the day and time when you take the Wegovy injection, you can do so two or more days after taking your last Wegovy dose.",
        "Do I have to take Wegovy on an empty stomach?",
        "You can take the Wegovy injection on an empty stomach or after your meal. Both methods are fine. It all depends on your convenience.",

        "Is Ozempic a substitute for Wegovy?",
        "Although Wegovy and Ozempic both contain semaglutide, they are different products with different uses and dosages as approved by the FDA. Each medication is safe and effective in its own way. As a result, they are not interchangeable.",
        "Is there a generic version of Wegovy?",
        "Currently, there is no generic version of Wegovy available in the global market. This is because the manufacturer of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, has patented the medicine until 2026. As a result, other pharmaceutical companies cannot produce or sell generic versions of Wegovy until that time.",
        "If a generic version is available in the grey market, is it okay to use it instead of the actual Wegovy injection?",
        "Novo Nordisk, as the manufacturer of Wegovy, cannot validate the safety and efficacy of any generic version of the injection available in the grey market. As such, it is not advisable to risk your health by using generic or counterfeit medicines for weight loss.",

Releases insulin GLP-1 hormone signals the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar is high. It helps move sugar into cells for energy. Slows digestion The hormone slows down the movement of food through your stomach, making you feel full for longer after eating. Reduces sugar production in the liver The hormone decreases the amount of sugar a liver produces when it is not required. Controls appetite GLP-1 affects the areas of the brain that control appetite. As a result, you feel less hungry. As a result, by imitating GLP-1, Wegovy helps you eat less and feel full, which reduces calories and helps you lose weight.

        "Wegovy contains semaglutide, while Mounjaro contains tirzepatide, which targets both GLP-1 and GIP hormones.",
        "Because of this, Mounjaro may cause more gastrointestinal side effects in some users. But it may also offer greater weight loss for others.",
        "As for safety, both come with similar risks:",
        "Can Wegovy cause Ozempic face?",
        "'Ozempic face' refers to the tired or hollow look some people get after losing weight quickly. It manifests in the form of sunken cheeks, looser skin, or more visible wrinkles. It happens because of quick fat loss throughout the body, and especially from the face.",
        "Wegovy, like other GLP-1 meds, can lead to similar changes if weight loss happens too fast. Losing weight gradually while focusing on your diet and exercise can help minimise this.",
        "Can I take a break from Wegovy?",
        "It’s best not to skip doses of Wegovy on purpose. This medication works best when it’s taken consistently every week. Missing a dose can reduce appetite control and bring back side effects when you restart.",
        "If you miss a dose:",
        "If you have missed more than one dose, you should check in with your doctor. They may ask you to go back to a lower dose so you adjust easily.",
        "Can Wegovy cause heart attacks?",
        "There’s no direct evidence that Wegovy causes heart attacks in healthy users. In fact, GLP-1 medications like Wegovy have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes.",
        "However, if you already have a heart condition, your doctor will want to monitor you more closely, especially when you are adjusting to Wegovy during your initial days.",
        "Why am I still so hungry on Wegovy?",
        "Wegovy reduces appetite for most people, but not everyone feels that effect right away. If you’re still hungry:",
        "Who should not use Wegovy?",
        "Wegovy is not recommended for:",
        "Always talk to your doctor before starting Wegovy to make sure it’s a safe fit.",
        "Is it safe to take Wegovy for life?",
        "Wegovy is generally considered safe for long-term use, but ongoing studies are still tracking its effects beyond 2–3 years.",
        "However, like any medication, there are potential risks associated with prolonged use. Possible long-term side effects include pancreatitis, gallbladder disease (such as gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder), and kidney damage.",
        "If it helps you manage your weight and improve health markers like blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, your doctor may recommend staying on it long-term and even monitor your health while you are on Wegovy.",
        "What happens if you stop Wegovy?",
        "You may also see a reduction in the side effects from the medication, usually within the first week of stopping.",
        "Although stopping Wegovy is not harmful, it comes with a few changes, like:",
        "If you're thinking of pausing or quitting Wegovy, don’t do it abruptly. Discuss this with your doctor. They may suggest tapering the dose or suggest alternatives that work better for you.",
        "Can Wegovy cause depression?",
        "Although rare, Wegovy might cause or worsen depression and mood changes in some people.",
        "Recent studies [2][3] and adverse event reports have linked semaglutide to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, especially at higher doses or in those with a history of mental health issues.",
        "But in Indian trials or safety monitoring, no statistically significant psychiatric side effects have been reported.",
        "That said, this aspect needs more research. Still, regulatory agencies advise monitoring mental health during treatment, particularly if you or your family has a history of mental health issues.",

And if you're here, reading this, chances are you're wondering the same. In this article: Key takeaways: How does Wegovy work in the body? Why does Wegovy cause side effects? What are the side effects of taking Wegovy? Do the side effects go away over time? How to manage Wegovy side effects? Why Wegovy affects different people in different ways? When should you visit the doctor? To put it briefly Key takeaways: Wegovy can cause side effects like nausea, tiredness, constipation, and stomach discomfort. Most side effects are seen during dose increase and go away with time. Sensitivity to Wegovy can vary based on gut health, age, and medical history. You have heard about Wegovy’s weight loss results and seen the before-and-after pictures. Your doctor is endorsing it, too. It looks promising. But a part of you hesitates. What if the side effects hit you hard? What if your body reacts badly to it? What if the adverse effects are irreversible? Yes, Wegovy has some side effects. But this is not the full story. In this guide, we’ll walk you through what those side effects look like, why they happen, and what you can do to feel better. How does Wegovy work in the body? How does Wegovy work? Mimics natural hormone GLP-1 Slows digestion so you feel fuller for longer Signals your brain that you’re full Smaller portions satiate your hunger You experience fewer cravings Your blood sugar levels stay steady You lose weight gradually and healthily To understand Wegovy’s side effects better, we first need to know what exactly happens when we take the medicine. Wegovy works by mimicking the actions of a hormone in your body called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1). Controls appetite: Wegovy targets the parts of your brain that control hunger. This reduces food cravings and makes it easier to eat less without feeling too hungry. Keeps you full for longer: It slows how quickly food leaves your stomach. As a result, meals keep you satisfied for longer, which naturally reduces the urge to overeat. Supports blood sugar control: After meals, Wegovy helps your body release more insulin and lowers glucagon levels in the blood. This helps you: Stay full even with smaller meals. Feel less hungry between meals. Cut down on cravings. Manage blood sugar more effectively. Lose weight steadily over time. Why does Wegovy cause side effects? The reason why people experience side effects while on Wegovy is that the body is adjusting to new changes. GLP-1 receptors are present in the gut, brain, pancreas, heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. When these receptors are activated by Wegovy, they affect how your body digests food, controls hunger, and regulates insulin. That’s why symptoms like nausea, bloating, or tiredness are common in the beginning. They are signs that your body is shifting gears. What are the side effects of taking Wegovy? Like any medicine, Wegovy can cause side effects. But not everyone gets them, and most are mild and temporary. According to the patient information leaflet , here are the side effects you must watch out for: Mild side effects Very common side effects: Headache Nausea Vomiting Diarrhoea Pain in the abdomen Fatigue Constipation Common side effects: Dizziness Indigestion or upset stomach Swollen abdomen Burping or gas Gastritis (inflamed stomach lining) Heartburn or acid reflux Gallstones Hair loss Injection site reactions Low blood sugar Diabetic retinopathy (a condition that may cause loss of vision) in people with type 2 diabetes. Uncommon side effects: Faster-than-usual heart rate Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure that happens while standing up after sitting or lying down) Sudden inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis) Serious side effects: They don’t happen as frequently, but are important to know. Worsening diabetic retinopathy ( diabetic eye disease) Inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) Acute gallstone disease Kidney or bladder stones Thyroid tumours, including cancer Severe allergic reactions Bowel obstruction These side effects demand prompt medical attention. Do the side effects go away over time? Yes, most Wegovy side effects do get better with time. Symptoms like nausea, tiredness, headache, constipation, or diarrhoea are common in the initial days of increasing your dose. Nausea often takes 7-8 days to settle. Diarrhoea usually lasts 3 days. Vomiting gets better after 2 days. Constipation can take about 47 days on average to go away. Important: Wegovy side effects are temporary and improve as your body adjusts. In case the side effects persist or worsen over time, please get in touch with your doctor. How to manage Wegovy side effects? Usually, doctors prescribe the lowest dose first and increase gradually. This is to give your body some time to get used to the new medication. These simple and easy-to-follow tips will help you manage some common Wegovy side effects better: How to manage Wegovy side effects? For nausea: Eat several small meals instead of a couple of large ones. Start your meals by eating thin dal or clear soup first. Avoid masala and oil in your food for some time. Eat mindfully. Stay hydrated with adrak chai, pudina tea, jeera water, or nimbu paani. Add hing in dals for better digestion. For vomiting: Drink ORS or sweet lemon water. Have light meals like khichdi or curd rice. Avoid lying down immediately after meals. Take small but frequent sips of water. Try taking Wegovy before going to bed to sleep through symptoms. For diarrhoea: Rehydrate with nimbu paani, nariyal paani, or lassi. Eat apples, bananas, or curd rice. Consume isabgol (psyllium husk) if your doctor permits. For constipation: Drink at least 8–10 glasses of water daily. Try triphala churna if your doctor permits. Consume soaked methi seeds. Have more whole vegetables, whole grains, and papaya. For decreased appetite: Eat protein-rich foods like dal, paneer, soya, etc. Start taking multivitamins if your doctor permits. Eat small meals and do not force-feed yourself. For fatigue: Stay well-hydrated. Eat nutritious grains such as ragi, jowar, sattu, etc. Consume iron-rich foods like spinach and beetroot. For headaches: Drink 8-10 glasses of water every day. Sleep for at least 8 hours a day. Sleep at the same time each day. Use over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Drink tulsi or chamomile tea for relief. For injection site reactions: Rotate the injection sites every time. Use a cold compress if there's swelling or discomfort at the site.

You might feel, “Why does Wegovy affect me differently than others?” You're not imagining it. Sensitivity to a particular medication can be different for everyone. Some reasons include: You may have medical conditions related to the kidneys, eyes, or thyroid gland, which may affect your body’s ability to process Wegovy. You have a sensitive gut (perhaps because of IBS, IBD, Crohn's, etc.) Age and metabolism. Taking insulin or other medications like antidiabetics, anti-hypertensives, antidepressants, etc. Genetics Remember: If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You might need a slower dose increase, or simply more time to adjust. When should you visit the doctor? Certain conditions or symptoms while on Wegovy may warrant you to visit your doctor as early as possible: A lump in your neck, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or shortness of breath. Severe or ongoing stomach pain, with or without vomiting. Feeling lightheaded, weak, or dehydrated due to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea. Yellowing of your skin or eyes, dark urine, or pale stools. The heartbeat feels fast or irregular while at rest. Low blood sugar symptoms such as shakiness, confusion, or sweating. Changes in vision, especially if you have diabetes. Feeling unusually tired, dizzy, or mentally unwell. Swelling, breathing difficulty, or skin reactions after an injection. Difficulty urinating, lower abdominal pain, or notice a change in urine colour. Bloating or constipation that does not improve. To put it briefly Yes, side effects can be frustrating, but they don't last forever. The long-term goal with Wegovy or any weight loss plan is to help you feel better at a sustainable pace. And when you stay consistent and ask for help when needed, progress follows. 🎉 Launched in India in June 2025 Wegovy is available in India in the form of pre-filled injection pen (FlexTouch). You can either self-inject it or take it with the help of a healthcare professional. Read more about Wegovy FAQs What medications should you not take with Wegovy? A drug interaction happens when the presence of one drug affects the actions of the second drug. Wegovy, too, can interact with different medications and supplements. Some examples include painkillers (NSAIDs), certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and some blood pressure medications. Also, combining Wegovy with insulin, oral diabetes medications and other GLP-1 (or GIP) agents can cause undesirable effects. Always inform your doctor if you are taking any medications. Does Wegovy cause hair loss? Although there is no direct link between hair loss and Wegovy, some people do notice more hair fall after starting on the drug. In a clinical trial [1] involving around 1961 people over 68 weeks, around 2.5 % participants reported hair loss. That said, most participants recovered while still taking the weight loss treatment with Wegovy. What happens if you eat too much food on Wegovy? Wegovy slows down how quickly your stomach empties, so you'll feel full much sooner than usual. So eating past that new 'full point' will increase the chances of gastrointestinal side effects like: Nausea Bloating or stomach discomfort Acid reflux Vomiting, especially during dose escalation Overeating on Wegovy isn’t dangerous in most cases, but it can be really uncomfortable. If it happens, you may need to eat simple, light meals for some time and visit your doctor. Which one is safer? Wegovy or Mounjaro? Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are considered safe when used as prescribed, but they work slightly differently and may suit different people. Wegovy contains semaglutide, while Mounjaro contains tirzepatide, which targets both GLP-1 and GIP hormones. Because of this, Mounjaro may cause more gastrointestinal side effects in some users. But it may also offer greater weight loss for others. As for safety, both come with similar risks: Nausea, vomiting, constipation Possible risk of pancreatitis A thyroid warning based on animal studies. Can Wegovy cause Ozempic face? 'Ozempic face' refers to the tired or hollow look some people get after losing weight quickly. It manifests in the form of sunken cheeks, looser skin, or more visible wrinkles. It happens because of quick fat loss throughout the body, and especially from the face. Wegovy, like other GLP-1 meds, can lead to similar changes if weight loss happens too fast. Losing weight gradually while focusing on your diet and exercise can help minimise this. Can I take a break from Wegovy? It’s best not to skip doses of Wegovy on purpose. This medication works best when it’s taken consistently every week. Missing a dose can reduce appetite control and bring back side effects when you restart. If you miss a dose: Take it within five days. If it’s been more than 5 days, skip it and take the next one as scheduled. Don’t double-dose. If you have missed more than one dose, you should check in with your doctor. They may ask you to go back to a lower dose so you adjust easily. Can Wegovy cause heart attacks? There’s no direct evidence that Wegovy causes heart attacks in healthy users. In fact, GLP-1 medications like Wegovy have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. However, if you already have a heart condition, your doctor will want to monitor you more closely, especially when you are adjusting to Wegovy during your initial days. Why am I still so hungry on Wegovy? Wegovy reduces appetite for most people, but not everyone feels that effect right away. If you’re still hungry: Your dose may still be too low (especially in the first few weeks). You might be confusing emotional hunger or habit-driven eating with real hunger. Skipping meals or not eating enough protein and fibre can also make you feel hungrier. Who should not use Wegovy? Wegovy is not recommended for: People with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer. Those with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Women who are pregnant or trying to conceive. Women who are currently breastfeeding. Anyone allergic to semaglutide or other ingredients in the injection. Always talk to your doctor before starting Wegovy to make sure it’s a safe fit. Is it safe to take Wegovy for life? Wegovy is generally considered safe for long-term use, but ongoing studies are still tracking its effects beyond 2–3 years. However, like any medication, there are potential risks associated with prolonged use. Possible long-term side effects include pancreatitis, gallbladder disease (such as gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder), and kidney damage. If it helps you manage your weight and improve health markers like blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, your doctor may recommend staying on it long-term and even monitor your health while you are on Wegovy. What happens if you stop Wegovy? You may also see a reduction in the side effects from the medication, usually within the first week of stopping. Although stopping Wegovy is not harmful, it comes with a few changes, like: Return of appetite to pre-treatment levels. Increased food cravings. Weight regain (if a healthy diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes are not followed). Feel fatigued than usual. Increased blood sugar levels. Changes in mood (disappointment, sadness). If you're thinking of pausing or quitting Wegovy, don’t do it abruptly. Discuss this with your doctor. They may suggest tapering the dose or suggest alternatives that work better for you. Can Wegovy cause depression? Although rare, Wegovy might cause or worsen depression and mood changes in some people. Recent studies [2] [3] and adverse event reports have linked semaglutide to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, especially at higher doses or in those with a history of mental health issues. But in Indian trials or safety monitoring, no statistically significant psychiatric side effects have been reported. That said, this aspect needs more research. Still, regulatory agencies advise monitoring mental health during treatment, particularly if you or your family has a history of mental health issues. If you notice new or worsening mood symptoms while on Wegovy, it’s important to speak to your doctor. View programme Do I qualify?

        "4.75 out of 5 based on 56 reviews",
        "Juggling a senior executive role meant constant travel and zero time for myself. Aktive’s science-backed approach was perfectly flexible for my demanding life. The weight is down, my sleep quality has improved massively. This program gave me back my health without sacrificing my career.",
        "After having my second child, I was stuck. The weight wouldn't move, and I constantly felt exhausted and demotivated. Aktive showed me how to control my constant food cravings. Their personalized support helped me overcome plateaus. My clothes fit beautifully, I have the stamina to handle the kids and the home, and the confidence is back.",
        "Being a business owner meant 12-hour days on my feet, constant pain, and low energy. Aktive’s simple plan worked even during the busiest seasons. Now, the joint pain is gone, I'm sharper with customers, and I have the energy to manage my business and reclaim my health.",
        "Starting my first job was overwhelming; I lived on nightly takeout and sacrificed fitness. I gained weight and felt foggy in meetings. Aktive's realistic plan helped me quickly drop the 'job weight.' My focus and energy are now consistently high, leaving me confident and sharp for the office.",
        "I was constantly battling my sweet tooth and felt like every diet was a losing fight. Aktive didn't just tell me what to eat; it helped me control my cravings. My clothes fit better, and I no longer feel guilty after a meal. It's truly amazing how much a simple programme, paired with the right guidance, can change everything.",
        "My diet was a disaster with long office hours and client dinners. Aktive showed me how to manage my diet and deal with stress eating without sacrificing my work-life balance. The weight is down, my energy is up, and I no longer feel drained. It’s the best investment I’ve made in my health and career.",
        "As a diabetic, I always felt that weight loss was tricky. I struggled with cravings and following other diets. Thanks to Aktive’s plan, my sugar readings are finally in range, and I am losing weight steadily. I can climb stairs without panting and feel more energetic than before. The best part? I don’t have to starve myself.",
        "My schedule made it hard for me to devote time to weight loss. I was tired and struggling to keep up with my kids. Aktive’s personalised weight loss plan fit my routine perfectly. Within weeks, I had more energy and could finally run around with my kids. No more knee pain during walks. Weekend outings with my family feel fun again!",
        "Tried every fad diet in the book, but couldn't resist eating junk food. With Aktive, I can finally control my sweet cravings and lose weight. Friends and colleagues began noticing the change. Their compliments motivate me even more to stay fit. Will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a lasting weight loss solution.",
        "I used to think weight loss meant giving up all my favourite foods. For the first time, I don’t feel guilty about eating. With Aktive’s customised meal plans, I am slowly but surely losing weight while still enjoying home-cooked meals! My energy is better and my clothes fit looser. Aktive taught me the importance of balancing meals.",

        "Jugal S.",
        "Even after years of hardcore diets and major lifestyle changes, my weight did not budge. Stepping on the weighing scale felt like a nightmare. But with Aktive, I noticed the difference in my weight right from the start. I am now eating less yet feeling full for longer. Weight loss is truly so simple with Aktive. Wish I found it sooner!",
        "Gauri D.",
        "My hectic schedule made me put on weight. I tried keto diet, intermittent fasting, paleo diet, and what not! NOTHING WORKED. Ever since I started it, I am craving less junk and feeling full after a few bites. I can REALLY stop after two spoons of ice cream or two pieces of chips.",
        "Manas K.",
        "I never have the time for costly, time consuming diets. But my weight kept piling on, and I needed a solution that ACTUALLY WORKS. This one does. Unhealthy food cravings are gone, I feel more energised.",
        "Riya D.",
        "It works like magic. Growing up, I always heard that weight is stubborn. But, the plan helped me melt that stubborn weight within 12 months! It naturally suppressed my hunger, so I did not even have to starve myself to meet my weight loss goals. The best part? All the materials included in the plan were delivered to my home for free.",
        "Purvi J.",
        "Aktive eased my weight loss struggles. It helped me lose significant weight in just a few months and gave me the confidence to look at myself in the mirror with a smile once again. My old clothes fit me well, and I can’t wait to go shopping and get my dream dress. Finally, I feel beautiful, inside and out!",
        "Ankit L.",
        "Unhealthy eating made me gain weight. When I found it hard to lose weight, I turned to Aktive’s weight loss programmes. It really works. The only drawback? There are a few side effects, such as nausea, headache, and lack of appetite, but for me, they didnt last very long.",
        "Shweta V.",
        "This product is good, and the service is smooth too. I got doorstep delivery, and the plan is not the best one out there, but it works nicely. I stopped binge eating within 2-3 days of starting it, and did not face any significant side effects too. Its not perfect, but so far, its been tolerable.

        "Why is your treatment more effective than other weight loss methods?",
        "Our treatment works on many levels. The active ingredient works by making your body produce more of a specific hormone that affects how hungry you feel.",
        "Increasing these hormone levels slows down digestion and stomach emptying. It affects your appetite because your brain gets the signal \"I'm full' much quicker. Which means you eat less.",
        "The medication also resets your metabolism. You have a set point that your body defends to maintain. It gives you hunger signals if you drop below this point. The hormones reset this point to a lower level.",
        "This makes it easier to stick to new eating habits.",
        "What should I go for - weight loss injection or tablet?",
        "At Aktive, we offer both weight loss injections and tablets.",
        "While both forms of weight loss medicines are effective in the long run, what will really work for you depends on your weight loss goals, which form you are most comfortable with, and the efficacy of the medicine.",
        "In the end, it is up to you to decide which form of medicine works best for you. Aktive is here to help you lose weight, no matter what you choose.",
        "I've heard of the Hollywood 'skinny jab' - is this the same?",
        "Yes. The popular term 'skinny jab' refers to treatments. However, while it sounds like it will make you 'skinny', that is not necessarily correct.",
        "It is a prescription medication designed to aid weight loss for health reasons.",
        "Like any prescription medication, our partner doctors will still need to consider your medical history before prescribing it.",
        "How much weight can I lose on your plan?",
        "Clinical trials have demonstrated that our weight loss injection is quite effective. Adults lost an average of 21% of their body weight after 16 months.",
        "However, weight loss is not a linear journey. How much weight you’ll lose on our plan depends on various individual factors such as your starting weight, medical history, regular diet, and exercise schedule.",
        "When do I qualify for your plan?",
        "Our weight loss plan is available on prescription for people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or above.",
        "Some other health issues can prevent our partner doctors from prescribing these medications to you. You can find out if it's safe by taking our quiz. It’s free.",
        "What is BMI?",
        "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of calculating your ideal body weight based on your height. When you take our quiz, it will calculate your BMI so you can know if you’re eligible. There are also online tools to calculate your BMI.",
        "Why am I struggling to lose weight?",
        "For some people, eating less and exercising more is not enough. Studies show that your genes can significantly affect how you carry weight. For some people, genetic influence can be as high as 80%.",
        "If you’re not seeing progress, you may want to reevaluate your strategy - and our treatment might be the answer. By feeling full more quickly and for longer, it’s easier to reduce your calorie intake and lose weight successfully.",
        "Do I need to go on a diet?",
        "Following a healthy lifestyle is the best way to get the best results from weight loss treatment. You should reduce the number of calories you consume and eat a healthy, balanced diet.",
        "Our personalised meal plan helps you to avoid eating very fatty and sugary foods, as they are high in calories and lacking in nutrients.",
        "Our fitness plan helps with light exercise, 3 times a week. Both factors will help you get the most out of your weight loss treatment and speed up results.",
        "Why do I need to do the medical consultation?",
        "Our partner doctors review your answers to determine if our weight loss plan is safe for you. As we provide prescription medications, it’s important you answer all questions honestly.",
        "Do I know immediately if I qualify for treatment?",
        "Once you’ve placed your order, our partner doctors review your medical history. If they have additional questions, we'll contact you via email. We will not take payment unless you qualify and we can send you the treatment.",
        "What's included in the weight loss subscription plan?",
        "Our subscription includes a delivery service every 4 weeks, with each package containing 4 weeks of treatment. Our partner doctors will check your health every month and monitor your progress. Our plans also include support from a nutritionist and health coach. This way, we can give you the support you need. Our plans are all-inclusive: treatment, free delivery, personalised meal plan, fitness plan and support from our weight loss specialists.",
        "Will you monitor my health and progress?",
        "Yes, our partner doctors will ask you to update your health information before each delivery. This way, they can monitor how you are doing and give you additional advice if needed.",

        "But here’s the thing…except for plain water, no food is truly calorie-free.",
        "But that doesn't mean you cannot find healthy, low-calorie foods in your kitchen.",
        "If you're trying to eat lighter without feeling starved, these low-calorie foods deserve a permanent place on your plate.",
        "Read this list to discover everyday foods that are low in calories and are readily available at your local vegetable market. Nothing fancy, nothing gourmet, nothing pricey. It’s affordable and accessible.",
        "So, are you ready to discover a more innovative way to stay healthy?",
        "First things first: no fruit, vegetable, or dish is truly \"zero calorie.\" The only real zero-calorie ingredient is plain water.",
        "So, what are low-calorie foods?",
        "There isn't a fixed definition, but here’s a general idea.",
        "Low-calorie foods, as the name suggests, are foods that contain very few calories per serving. They can add volume, fibre, or water to your meal.",
        "If images of a cucumber or a watermelon are floating in your mind, you are on the right track.",
        "You can eat these foods in larger quantities and still fulfil your daily calorie goals.",
        "However, keep in mind that these foods do not help you burn fat on their own. They only support weight loss when consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet.",
        "Basically, low-calorie foods make you feel full and don’t add up much to your daily calorie intake, so you eat well and don’t crave more food.",
        "We have all grown up with the idea that when we eat less, we lose more weight.",
        "However, the truth is that when we starve ourselves, we end up feeling hungrier, more tired, and more prone to cravings. And that isn't sustainable.",
        "Here's why eating low-calorie foods is a wise choice:",
        "Without much ado, let’s see which low-calorie foods we need to add to our diet.",
        "1. Cucumber (Kheera)",
        "Calories: Approx. 10 calories per 100g",
        "Crisp, cooling, and made up of over 95% water, kheera is a classic Indian summer staple. It also contains small amounts of potassium and vitamin K, which makes it a great option for hydration and mild electrolyte support.",
        "Did you know?",
        "Cucumber has been cultivated for over 3,000 years. It was even used in ancient Indian and Egyptian cultures as a cooling remedy!",
        "How to add it to your diet:",
        "2. Spinach (Palak)",
        "Calories: Approx. 22-28 calories per 100g",
        "The bright green foliage of palak is a powerhouse of iron, folate, and vitamin A.",
        "Popeye’s favourite food adds bulk, fibre, and colour to your plate, nourishing you well.",
        "How to add it to your diet:",
        "3. Zucchini (Courgette)",
        "Calories: Approx. 16-19 calories per 100g.",
        "Light, juicy, and mild in taste, zucchini is a vegetable that is steadily growing in popularity across India. It is rich in antioxidants (like lutein and zeaxanthin), folate, potassium, vitamin C, and fibre. It has nearly 95% water, and almost no fat!",
        "The best part is that zucchini can easily be incorporated into Indian dishes, making it perfect for days when you want to eat more volume but stay within your calorie limit.",
        "How to add it to your diet:",
        "4. Mushrooms (Khumb/Khumbi/Kukurmutta)",
        "Calories: Approx. 25-31 calories per 100g",
        "Earthy, chewy, and surprisingly filling, mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, selenium, and antioxidants.",
        "Interestingly, when exposed to sunlight, they’re also one of the rare vegetarian sources of vitamin D!",
        "How to add it to your diet:",
        "Most of the vegetables mentioned above pair well with grilled or raw paneer. With just the right amount of protein and calories in 100g paneer, this white delight can cover a huge portion of your daily protein needs.",

But here’s the thing…except for plain water, no food is truly calorie-free. But that doesn't mean you cannot find healthy, low-calorie foods in your kitchen. In this article: Key takeaways What are zero-calorie or low-calorie foods? Why do we need zero-calorie or low-calorie foods? 9 best low-calorie foods to try for weight loss How to eat low-calorie foods smartly? Key takeaways Only water has zero calories . Low-calorie foods are rich in water and fibre. These foods don’t burn fat, but they support weight loss when paired with a balanced diet. Eating low-calorie foods can reduce cravings and make you feel full. If you're trying to eat lighter without feeling starved, these low-calorie foods deserve a permanent place on your plate. Read this list to discover everyday foods that are low in calories and are readily available at your local vegetable market. Nothing fancy, nothing gourmet, nothing pricey. It’s affordable and accessible. So, are you ready to discover a more innovative way to stay healthy? What are zero-calorie or low-calorie foods? First things first: no fruit, vegetable, or dish is truly \"zero calorie.\" The only real zero-calorie ingredient is plain water. So, what are low-calorie foods? There isn't a fixed definition, but here’s a general idea. Low-calorie foods, as the name suggests, are foods that contain very few calories per serving . They can add volume, fibre, or water to your meal. If images of a cucumber or a watermelon are floating in your mind, you are on the right track. You can eat these foods in larger quantities and still fulfil your daily calorie goals. However, keep in mind that these foods do not help you burn fat on their own. They only support weight loss when consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Basically, low-calorie foods make you feel full and don’t add up much to your daily calorie intake, so you eat well and don’t crave more food. Why do we need zero-calorie or low-calorie foods? We have all grown up with the idea that when we eat less, we lose more weight. However, the truth is that when we starve ourselves, we end up feeling hungrier, more tired, and more prone to cravings. And that isn't sustainable. Here's why eating low-calorie foods is a wise choice: We can eat more without overstepping our daily calorie needs. They’re rich in fibre, so they digest slowly and keep you satisfied. They help manage hunger and stick to your routine. They do not restrict your eating habits.
